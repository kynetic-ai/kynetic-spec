      Subagent review on task complete - when agent marks task complete, include instructions to
      spawn review subagent. Subagent runs kspec task review to get task details, linked spec,
      acceptance criteria, git diff since started_at. Reports gaps between spec and implementation
      back to main agent. Configurable via setup (opt-in/out). Ties into alignment system.

      Hook for SessionStart or post-compaction to inject relevant context and subtle instructions.
      Could auto-run 'kspec session start' or similar to give agent fresh context after memory is
      compacted.

      Artifacts feature - storage for large files and non-text artifacts tied to specs/tasks. Use
      cases: reference images, research docs, generated diagrams, data files, PDFs. Unknowns:
      integration model (spec-ref? task-ref? standalone?), reference syntax (@artifact?),
      organization (by task? by type? flat?), cleanup/lifecycle (archive with task? manual?),
      storage location (artifacts/ dir? .kspec/artifacts?), git handling (LFS? gitignore?
      committed?).

      Spec review process: 3 parallel agents (internal fit, prior art comparison, external research)
      before finalizing major specs. Worked well for shadow branch spec design - should be
      formalized in meta-spec workflows.

      Spec notes feature - append-only notes on spec items for capturing implementation gotchas,
      learnings, and context. Similar to task notes but for specs. Use case: documenting things like
      'git worktree prune needed for orphaned worktrees' that are valuable for
      maintenance/reimplementation but don't belong in formal AC.

      Alignment system spec coverage gap - AlignmentIndex, auto-sync, validation commands (kspec
      item status, alignment check) were implemented pragmatically without spec. Need to create spec
      items documenting: alignment concept, AlignmentIndex structure, auto-sync behavior, alignment
      validation, guidance output format.

      Item list --tree or --hierarchy flag - shows parent/child structure for finding where to place
      new items. Friction: during triage had to grep/search to find @cli module since flat list
      doesn't show nesting.

      CLI output parity - JSON and human-readable outputs can drift when adding features.
      Investigate patterns to keep them in sync by design: unified output formatter, schema-driven
      rendering, shared data structure that both modes consume. Current pattern: output(data,
      humanFormatter) - data goes to JSON, formatter handles human. But formatter can show
      derived/computed info that isn't in data.

      AC-driven testing practice - acceptance criteria should guide test coverage. Pattern
      established: tests annotated with '// AC: @spec-item ac-N' comments for traceability. Consider
      adding to AGENTS.md workflow guidance.

      Integration test performance - tests take 50-75s which discourages frequent runs. Investigate:
      parallel test execution, fixture caching, test isolation overhead, selective test runs
      (--grep). Goal: fast feedback loop during development.

      Spec-linked commit format and code annotations - standardize commits to include task/spec refs
      (e.g., 'Task: @slug', 'Spec: @ref') enabling git log --grep searches. Consider: kspec commit
      wrapper command that auto-formats message with current task context, code annotation pattern
      (// Spec: @slug ac-N), retroactive tagging of existing commits, searchable cross-linking
      between git history and specs. Benefits: specs stay clean (no stale code refs), natural audit
      trail, powerful search (find all commits for a feature). Related: AC-driven test annotations
      already using this pattern.

      Stale status detection in validate - warn when: (1) umbrella/parent task is pending but child
      spec items are all implemented, (2) spec item marked implemented but no completed tasks
      reference it, (3) task marked completed but linked spec still not_started. Could be part of
      --completeness flag or separate --staleness check. Detected manually this session: Shadow
      Branch parent task was pending while all children implemented.
