      Subagent review on task complete - when agent marks task complete, include instructions to
      spawn review subagent. Subagent runs kspec task review to get task details, linked spec,
      acceptance criteria, git diff since started_at. Reports gaps between spec and implementation
      back to main agent. Configurable via setup (opt-in/out). Ties into alignment system.

      Hook for SessionStart or post-compaction to inject relevant context and subtle instructions.
      Could auto-run 'kspec session start' or similar to give agent fresh context after memory is
      compacted.

      Reflection prompt on task complete - when completing a task, prompt agent to reflect: Did this
      address workflow friction? Any new friction discovered? Successes worth noting? More flexible
      than auto-resolution or explicit linking. Could be a hook or built into task complete flow.

      AGENTS.md standard compatibility - consider complementary approach where AGENTS.md provides
      instructions and kynetic.meta.yaml provides structured/queryable layer. Revisit when standard
      matures (currently 20k+ repos adopting).

      Artifacts feature - storage for large files and non-text artifacts tied to specs/tasks. Use
      cases: reference images, research docs, generated diagrams, data files, PDFs. Unknowns:
      integration model (spec-ref? task-ref? standalone?), reference syntax (@artifact?),
      organization (by task? by type? flat?), cleanup/lifecycle (archive with task? manual?),
      storage location (artifacts/ dir? .kspec/artifacts?), git handling (LFS? gitignore?
      committed?).

      Spec review process: 3 parallel agents (internal fit, prior art comparison, external research)
      before finalizing major specs. Worked well for shadow branch spec design - should be
      formalized in meta-spec workflows.

      CLI command for creating modules: kspec module add --title 'Shadow Branch' --slug
      shadow-branch. Would create the module YAML file with proper structure, ULIDs, etc. Currently
      modules must be created manually.

      Auto-generated CLI documentation - instead of manually listing commands in CLAUDE.md, generate
      from actual CLI structure. Options: (1) kspec commands output that lists all available
      commands with brief descriptions, (2) hook that regenerates a CLI_REFERENCE.md on command
      changes, (3) CLAUDE.md includes a dynamic reference via kspec introspection. Goal: docs stay
      in sync with implementation automatically.

      Spec notes feature - append-only notes on spec items for capturing implementation gotchas,
      learnings, and context. Similar to task notes but for specs. Use case: documenting things like
      'git worktree prune needed for orphaned worktrees' that are valuable for
      maintenance/reimplementation but don't belong in formal AC.

      Meta-spec implementation scope - just added ~10 new requirements (CRUD commands, validation,
      execution model, resolution loop). Consider deriving focused implementation tasks rather than
      one large task.
