      Subagent review on task complete - when agent marks task complete, include instructions to
      spawn review subagent. Subagent runs kspec task review to get task details, linked spec,
      acceptance criteria, git diff since started_at. Reports gaps between spec and implementation
      back to main agent. Configurable via setup (opt-in/out). Ties into alignment system.

      Artifacts feature - storage for large files and non-text artifacts tied to specs/tasks. Use
      cases: reference images, research docs, generated diagrams, data files, PDFs. Unknowns:

      organization (by task? by type? flat?), cleanup/lifecycle (archive with task? manual?),
      storage location (artifacts/ dir? .kspec/artifacts?), git handling (LFS? gitignore?

      'git worktree prune needed for orphaned worktrees' that are valuable for
      maintenance/reimplementation but don't belong in formal AC.

      Ralph Wiggum / Looper Mode - Create a kspec-integrated autonomous loop runner. Core idea: a
      script that runs Claude Code repeatedly with fresh context, using a templated prompt that
      instructs it to:


      1. Run 'kspec session start' to see ready tasks

      2. Pick a well-defined task (high priority, clear spec, no blockers)

      3. Work on it until completion or stuck

      4. Commit and complete the task

      5. Exit cleanly (the outer loop restarts with fresh context)


      Key features from research:

      - Simple core: while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done

      - Context persists via filesystem/git, not session memory

      - Dual-condition exit: require both completion indicator AND explicit exit signal

      - Circuit breaker: stop after N loops with no progress or repeated errors

      - Rate limiting for API calls


      Kspec-specific additions:

      - Task selection heuristics (prioritize: clear AC, no blockers, isolated scope)

      - Progress tracking via task notes before each exit

      - Session checkpoint before exit to ensure clean state

      - Maybe: task budget (only attempt tasks under estimated N turns)


      The beauty is each iteration starts fresh but inherits cumulative work. Bad iterations don't
      compound context - they just waste one run.

      Session checkpoint hook caught uncommitted .gitignore change. Important to follow
      never-commit-to-main rule - all changes should go through PRs. The hook successfully prevented

      Transaction/batch mechanics for kspec operations - ability to set a mark point where changes
      don't auto-commit until a final 'commit' call. Could help with bulk operations, rollback on
      errors, and atomic multi-item changes. Challenges: managing state across commands, cleanup on
      abandoned transactions, shadow branch implications. Maybe simpler approach: explicit 'kspec
      bulk' command that takes a script/list of operations and executes them atomically.

      Agent-first CLI redesign: Remove interactive prompts, add TTY detection


      ## Problem

      Current CLI has interactive prompts (cascade status updates, derive hints) that create
      friction for agent usage. Agents are primary users of kspec CLI, but design assumes human
      interaction.


      ## Research Findings


      ### Industry Standards

      - TTY detection is foundational: if stdout not TTY, assume non-interactive

      - Common flags: --yes/-y, --force/-f, --no-input, --json

      - CI environment detection (CI=true) auto-disables prompts

      - Risk-based prompts: only for truly destructive operations


      ### Agent Experience (AX) Principles

      - Determinism is non-negotiable: same command = same result

      - Structured output (JSON) should be default when not TTY

      - Errors as structured data with recovery hints

      - Idempotency enables safe retry

      - Tool annotations (readOnly, destructive, idempotent)


      ## Recommended Changes


      1. **Remove derive hint entirely** - Just prints suggestion, adds noise

      2. **Replace cascade prompt with --cascade flag** - Opt-in, deterministic

      3. **Keep delete --force requirement** - Truly destructive, safety net

      4. **Add TTY detection** - Auto-switch to JSON output, no prompts when not TTY

      5. **Respect CI environment variable** - CI=true means non-interactive

      6. **Consider --dry-run for all mutations** - Preview mode for safety


      ## Implementation Pattern

      ```javascript

      function isInteractive() {
        if (process.env.CI) return false;
        if (args['--no-input']) return false;
        return process.stdin.isTTY && process.stdout.isTTY;
      }

      ```

      Structured error responses with recovery hints


      ## Context

      Research on agent-first CLI design identified that errors should be structured data, not
      prose. Current kspec errors are text strings that agents must parse.


      ## Pattern

      Errors should follow schema with three components:

      1. What failed (error code)

      2. Why it failed (message + context)

      3. Recovery actions (1-3 concrete next steps)


      ## Example

      ```json

      {
        "success": false,
        "error": {
          "code": "REF_NOT_FOUND",
          "message": "Reference '@nonexistent' not found",
          "context": {"ref": "@nonexistent", "searched": ["tasks", "items"]},
          "recovery": [
            "Run 'kspec item list' to see available items",
            "Check spelling of the reference"
          ]
        }
      }

      ```


      ## Benefits

      - Agents can programmatically handle errors

      - Recovery hints guide next action

      - Exit codes map to error categories

      - Consistent schema across all commands

      Add --dry-run to all mutating commands


      ## Context

      Terraform's 'plan' command is the canonical example of safe mutation preview. Agent-first
      design emphasizes dry-run support for safety and debugging.


      ## Commands that should support --dry-run

      - item add/set/delete

      - task add/start/complete/cancel

      - derive

      - inbox promote

      - meta add/set/delete


      ## Behavior

      ```bash

      kspec derive @spec-item --dry-run

      # Output: Would create task 'implement-spec-item' with:

      #   title: Implement: Spec Item

      #   spec_ref: @spec-item

      #   priority: 3


      kspec task complete @task --dry-run

      # Output: Would mark task as completed

      #   status: completed

      #   completed_at: 2026-01-18T...

      ```


      ## Benefits

      - Agents can validate actions before executing

      - Debugging complex workflows

      - CI/CD validation without side effects

      - Matches Terraform/kubectl patterns
