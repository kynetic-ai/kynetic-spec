# Merge

Merge approved work into an integration branch. Local-first — uses git merge directly, with merge gates based on kspec review disposition.

## When to Use

- After work has been reviewed and approved via `/kspec-review`
- Merging a task branch into a dev or integration branch
- Completing the work lifecycle after review approval

**Not for:** Creating pull requests to remote repositories (that's a human-directed activity for feature-level merges into main).

## Merge Gate

Before merging, verify all gates pass:

```bash
# 1. Check review disposition
kspec review for-task @ref
kspec review get @review-ref
# Disposition must be "approved"

# 2. Required checks passing
# Review checks should show all required checks as "pass"

# 3. No unresolved blocker threads
# Review should have no open blocker threads
```

**All three must be satisfied:**

- Review disposition = `approved`
- All required checks passing (not stale)
- No unresolved blocker threads

If any gate fails, do not merge. Address the issue first:

- `changes_requested` → worker fixes issues, resubmits
- Required check failing → fix and re-run
- Unresolved blocker → resolve the thread or fix the issue

## Determining the Integration Branch

The merge target depends on context:

- **Dispatch mode** — The integration branch is provided in the dispatch prompt context (the `Integration target:` line) and via the `KSPEC_DISPATCH_MERGE_TARGET` environment variable. **Use the dispatch-provided target verbatim — never assume a branch name.**
- **Manual mode** — The integration branch is typically `dev`, but check your project's branching convention or ask if unsure.

In the examples below, `<integration-branch>` is a placeholder for the actual target branch.

## Merge Process

### 1. Verify Branch State

```bash
# Confirm current branch
git branch --show-current

# Ensure branch is up to date with target
git fetch origin
git log --oneline origin/<integration-branch>..HEAD  # What will be merged
```

### 2. Merge to Integration Branch

```bash
# Switch to target branch
git checkout <integration-branch>

# Merge with merge commit (preserves trailers)
git merge --no-ff <task-branch>

# Verify merge succeeded
git log --oneline -3
```

**Use merge commits, not squash.** Merge commits preserve individual commit messages with their `Task:` and `Spec:` trailers, enabling `kspec log @ref` to find related commits.

### 3. Handle Conflicts

If a merge conflict occurs:

**Assess the conflict:**

- Is it a simple textual conflict (parallel additive edits to the same region)?
- Or a semantic conflict (incompatible behavioral changes)?

**For simple/textual conflicts — resolve them:**

```bash
# View conflicting files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# Resolve conflicts in each file (include both sides for additive changes)
# Then mark resolved
git add <resolved-files>
git commit  # Completes the merge
```

Resolving straightforward textual conflicts is merge mechanics, not code authoring. Reviewers and workers should both handle these directly.

**For complex/semantic conflicts (reviewer):**

- Do not force-merge
- Abort the merge: `git merge --abort`
- Submit a **MUST-FIX** review finding describing the conflict: which files, what both sides changed, and why it's unclear how to resolve
- This sends the task back to the worker via `needs_work`, who has better context to resolve

**For complex/semantic conflicts (worker receiving needs_work):**

- Attempt best-effort non-destructive resolution using the reviewer's conflict description
- If genuinely uncertain about the correct resolution, block: `kspec task block @ref --reason "Merge conflict with ... — requires human judgment because ..."`

### 4. Complete the Task

After successful merge:

```bash
kspec task complete @ref --reason "Merged to <integration-branch>. Summary of what was done."
```

### 5. Close the Review

```bash
kspec review close @review-ref
```

## Post-Merge Cleanup

```bash
# Delete the task branch locally
git branch -d <task-branch>

# Optionally delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <task-branch>
```

## Integration

- **`/kspec-task-work`** — Work lifecycle leads to merge after review
- **`/kspec-review`** — Review disposition gates the merge
- **`kspec task complete`** — Final step after merge
