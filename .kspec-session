  @SPEC REVIEW TASKS - Work through these 7 tasks in order:


  TASK ORDER (by priority and dependencies):

  1. @01KFDYAW - Remove auth.yaml from manifest (simple cleanup)

  2. @01KFDYAJ - Validate trait system E2E (test before creating traits)

  3. @01KFDYAP - Create 8 core traits (needed by tasks 5-7)

  4. @01KFDYAS - Add AC to 17 critical spec items

  5. @01KFDYB4 - Apply traits to task lifecycle commands

  6. @01KFDYB7 - Apply traits to item CRUD commands

  7. @01KFDYBA - Apply traits to query and inbox commands


  EACH ITERATION:

  1. Run `kspec tasks ready` and check statuses of the 7 tasks above

  2. IF any task is `pending_review`: Validate that task's work by reviewing the changes, then
  `kspec task complete @ref --reason "Validated: ..."` if correct

  3. ELSE find the first task in the list above that is `pending`/ready:
     - Run `kspec task start @ref`
     - Follow the steps in the task notes (run `kspec task get @ref` to see them)
     - Add notes documenting what you did
     - Run `kspec task submit @ref` when done
  4. IF all 7 tasks are completed: Report success and stop


  VALIDATION CRITERIA for review:

  - For auth.yaml removal: Verify the line is removed from kynetic.yaml

  - For trait validation: Confirm test trait worked and was cleaned up

  - For trait creation: Verify 8 traits exist with proper AC

  - For AC additions: Verify the 17 items have appropriate AC

  - For trait applications: Verify traits field added to correct commands
