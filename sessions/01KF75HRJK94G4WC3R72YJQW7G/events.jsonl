You can then leverage that learning towards your own implementation. Don't just assume it is the right implementation but it can be useful. You would want to look at the implementation as well as the kspec history for the tasks/specs/notes and inboxes for any learnings worth leveraging. The two directories are: ../kspec-acp-test and ../kspec-ralph-test. **NOTE**: It is important to reflect on tasks and if there are any gaps in the spec, be it the AC don't adequately cover the explicit and implicit features and behavior or there are no AC at all. Use research and planning to fill those gaps including looking at the history of decisions/inbox/notes to better inform your path. Use notes on tasks liberally and the inbox as you find issues or things worth coming back to or fixing. When doing your end of iteration summary use the /reflect skill to identify things worth capturing for improvements/fixes/filling gaps later. If a task is under defined or doesn't seem worth doing for whatever reason outside of it already being done/implemented, then instead of removing it, lower the priority and leave a note as to why. If a task is too big leave a note as to why and make an inbox item to break it down later, but note you can try and break it apart yourself into multiple tasks leaving notes as to why and then another agent can pick up the rest. When you finish a task push it up as a PR. If you are starting your session and see a PR up please start by reviewing it, leaving your review feedback on the PR and as a note to the task it is from and then fix the issues. Once it is clean with no issues you can merge it (don't merge a PR you worked on either originally or after making fixes unless they are non-functional or trivial changes). Use the /pr skill for doing PRs."}}
