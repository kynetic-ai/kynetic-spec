Exit cleanly (the outer loop restarts with fresh context)\\n\\nKey features from research:\\n- Simple core: while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done\\n- Context persists via filesystem/git, not session memory\\n- Dual-condition exit: require both completion indicator AND explicit exit signal\\n- Circuit breaker: stop after N loops with no progress or repeated errors\\n- Rate limiting for API calls\\n\\nKspec-specific additions:\\n- Task selection heuristics (prioritize: clear AC, no blockers, isolated scope)\\n- Progress tracking via task notes before each exit\\n- Session checkpoint before exit to ensure clean state\\n- Maybe: task budget (only attempt tasks under estimated N turns)\\n\\nThe beauty is each iteration starts fresh but inherits cumulative work.

Pick the highest priority task (lowest number = higher priority). If there's an active (in_progress) task, continue that instead.\n\n2. **Start the task** (if not already in_progress):\n   ```bash\n   kspec task start @task-ref\n   ```\n\n3. **Do the work**:\n   - Read relevant files to understand the task\n   - Make changes as needed\n   - Run tests if applicable\n   - Document as you go with task notes\n\n4. **Document progress**:\n   ```bash\n   kspec task note @task-ref \"What you did, decisions made, etc.\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Submit or checkpoint**:\n   - If code is DONE (ready for PR):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task submit @task-ref\n     ```\n   - If task is NOT done (WIP):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task note @task-ref \"WIP: What's done, what remains...\"\n     ```\n\n6. **Commit your work**:\n   ```bash\n   git add -A && git commit -m \"feat/fix/chore: description\n\n   Task: @task-ref\"\n   ```\n\n7. **Reflect on this iteration**:\n   Think about what you learned, any friction points, or patterns worth remembering.\n\n   For **systemic patterns** (friction or success worth documenting):\n   ```bash\n   kspec meta observe friction \"Description of systemic issue...\"\n   kspec meta observe success \"Pattern worth replicating...\"\n   ```\n\n   For **actionable improvements** (specific ideas that could become tasks):\n   ```bash\n   kspec inbox add \"Improvement idea...\" --tag reflection\n   ```\n\n## Important Notes\n- Stay focused on ONE task per iteration\n- The loop continues automatically - don't worry about picking the next task\n- kspec tracks state across iterations via task status and notes\n- Always commit before the iteration ends\n- Always reflect and capture at least one observation\n","tasks":{"active":[],"ready":["01KFDYAP","01KFDYAS","01KFBBXC","01KFBBZC","01KFBD5P","01KFBD9N","01KFBJCD","01KFBKK2","01KFBPQA","01KFBX5F"]}}}

Create reusable traits for cross-cutting CLI patterns\n2. Fill acceptance criteria gaps across all modules\n3. Apply traits to existing specs to reduce duplication and ensure consistency\n\n**Note**: This plan produces **tasks** to do the work, not direct spec modifications.\n\n## Analysis Summary\n\n### Traits to Create (8 Core Traits)\n\nBased on analysis of 50+ CLI commands, these 8 patterns repeat across 4+ commands each:\n\n| Trait | Description | Commands Using |\n|-------|-------------|----------------|\n| `@trait-json-output` | `--json` flag, consistent JSON structure | 12+ commands |\n| `@trait-multi-ref-batch` | `--refs @a @b` batch operations | 5+ commands |\n| `@trait-confirmation-prompt` | `--force` to skip confirmation | 4+ commands |\n| `@trait-filterable-list` | `--status`, `--tag`, `--limit` filters | 7+ commands |\n| `@trait-priority-parameter` | `--priority 1-5` scale | 7+ commands |\n| `@trait-dry-run` | `--dry-run` preview mode | 6+ commands |\n| `@trait-semantic-exit-codes` | 0/1/2/3/4/5 exit code meanings | All commands |\n| `@trait-error-guidance` | Error messages with recovery suggestions | All commands |\n\n**Note on multi-ref**: The existing `@multi-ref-batch` feature has good AC but should also exist as a trait. As a trait, adding multi-ref support to a new command means adding `traits: [@trait-multi-ref-batch]` rather than updating the feature spec (proper direction of change).\n\n**Deferred patterns** (lower priority, may become traits later):\n- Task state machine (domain-specific to tasks)\n- Reference resolution (infrastructure, not command pattern)\n- Append-only notes (domain-specific)\n- Nested hierarchy (structural, not behavioral)\n- Slug uniqueness (validation concern)\n- Implementation status tracking (domain-specific)\n- Meta associations (domain-specific)\n- Verbosity levels (--verbose/--full)\n- Tree vs flat display modes\n- Spec-task alignment (domain-specific)\n- Slug generation (infrastructure)\n- Preview with limits (subset of dry-run)\n\n### AC Coverage Gaps\n\n**Methodology**: Counting only items with `type: requirement` or `type: feature` that describe testable behavior but have zero AC. Modules, decisions, and purely definitional items are excluded.\n\n**Items requiring AC: ~70 critical items** (subset of ~177 total items without AC)\n\nCritical gaps (must fix - these describe behavior):\n- `@type-module`, `@type-feature`, `@type-requirement`, `@type-constraint`, `@type-decision`, `@type-task` (schema.yaml) - 6 items\n- `@task-type-task`, `@task-type-epic`, `@task-type-bug`, `@task-type-spike`, `@task-type-infra` (tasks.yaml) - 5 items\n- `@yaml-version`, `@yaml-quoting`, `@yaml-multiline` (schema.yaml) - 3 items\n- `@rel-blocks`, `@rel-implements`, `@rel-relates-to` (core.yaml) - 3 items\n\nHigh priority gaps:\n- Various CLI command specs missing error case AC\n- Task schema fields missing validation AC\n- Meta CLI commands missing edge case AC\n\n**Note**: Many items without AC are definitional (modules, design principles) and don't require AC.\n\n### Code/Spec Misalignment\n\n| Issue | Severity | Status |\n|-------|----------|--------|\n| Task `automation` field missing from schema | HIGH | Spec exists, no code |\n| YAML convention validation | MEDIUM | Spec exists, no code |\n| Auto-adaptive file splitting | MEDIUM | Spec exists, no code |\n| Validation completeness (parent-child status) | LOW | Partially implemented |\n\n### Structural Issues\n\n- **auth.yaml**: Referenced in manifest but doesn't exist - **DECISION: Remove from manifest** (no auth-related specs exist in the project)\n- CLI module is 2684 lines (oversized vs ~500 for others) - **Deferred**: Document recommendation but don't split in this work\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 0: Validate Trait System (Pre-flight)\n\nBefore creating traits, verify the trait system works end-to-end:\n\n1. Create a single test trait via `kspec trait add \"Test Trait\" --description \"Validation test\"`\n2. Add one AC to it\n3. Verify `kspec trait list` shows the trait\n4. Apply it to a spec item and verify `kspec item get @spec` shows inherited AC\n5. Delete the test trait if successful, or investigate if issues\n\n**Why**: No traits exist currently. The system is implemented but untested in production.\n\n### Phase 1: Create Core Traits (8 traits)\n\nCreate trait definitions in `kynetic.yaml` root-level `traits` array:\n\n```yaml\n# kynetic.yaml\ntraits:\n  - _ulid: <generated>\n    slugs: [trait-json-output]\n    title: JSON Output Mode\n    type: trait\n    description: Commands support --json flag for structured JSON output\n    acceptance_criteria:\n      - id: ac-1\n        given: command supports JSON mode\n        when: --json flag provided\n        then: output is valid JSON with no ANSI color codes\n      - id: ac-2\n        given: JSON mode active\n        when: command completes\n        then: output includes all data available in human mode\n      # ... more AC per trait\n```\n\n**Traits to create (8 total):**\n1. `@trait-json-output` (6 AC) - JSON output mode support\n2. `@trait-multi-ref-batch` (8 AC) - Batch operations via --refs flag\n3. `@trait-confirmation-prompt` (6 AC) - Destructive operation confirmation\n4. `@trait-filterable-list` (7 AC) - List filtering and pagination\n5. `@trait-priority-parameter` (6 AC) - Priority 1-5 scale\n6. `@trait-dry-run` (6 AC) - Preview mode\n7. `@trait-semantic-exit-codes` (8 AC) - Consistent exit code meanings\n8. `@trait-error-guidance` (6 AC) - Error messages with suggestions\n\n**Location decision**: Traits go in `kynetic.yaml` (not a separate module) because:\n- Traits are cross-cutting, not domain-specific\n- The trait CLI already reads/writes to manifest\n- Keeps traits visible at project root level\n\n### Phase 2: Fill Critical AC Gaps (17 items)\n\nAdd acceptance criteria to items that describe testable behavior but have zero AC:\n\n**schema.yaml type requirements (6 items)**:\n- `@type-module`: AC for module validation, nesting rules\n- `@type-feature`: AC for feature structure\n- `@type-requirement`: AC for requirement structure\n- `@type-constraint`: AC for constraint validation\n- `@type-decision`: AC for decision records\n- `@type-task`: AC for task-type items in specs\n\n**tasks.yaml type requirements (5 items)**:\n- `@task-type-task`: AC for default task behavior\n- `@task-type-epic`: AC for epic-child relationships\n- `@task-type-bug`: AC for bug-specific behavior\n- `@task-type-spike`: AC for spike outcomes\n- `@task-type-infra`: AC for infrastructure tasks\n\n**core.yaml relationship requirements (3 items)**:\n- `@rel-blocks`: AC for blocking relationship behavior\n- `@rel-implements`: AC for implementation tracking\n- `@rel-relates-to`: AC for informational links\n\n**schema.yaml YAML requirements (3 items)**:\n- `@yaml-version`: AC for YAML 1.2 enforcement\n- `@yaml-quoting`: AC for quote validation rules\n- `@yaml-multiline`: AC for multiline format rules\n\n### Phase 3: Apply Traits to Existing Specs\n\nUpdate CLI command specs to declare traits they implement:\n\n```yaml\n# Example: @cmd-task-complete\n- _ulid: ...\n  slugs: [cmd-task-complete]\n  title: kspec task complete\n  type: requirement\n  traits:\n    - \"@trait-json-output\"\n    - \"@trait-multi-ref-batch\"\n    - \"@trait-semantic-exit-codes\"\n    - \"@trait-error-guidance\"\n  # Spec's own AC now only cover command-specific behavior\n  acceptance_criteria:\n    - id: ac-specific-1\n      given: task in in_progress state\n      when: kspec task complete @ref\n      then: status changes to completed\n```\n\n**Commands to update (highest value first)**:\n1. Task lifecycle commands (start, complete, cancel, block, unblock, submit, delete) - 7 commands\n2. Item CRUD commands (add, get, list, set, delete) - 5 commands\n3. Query commands (tasks list, tasks ready, tasks blocked, search) - 4 commands\n4. Inbox commands (add, list, promote, delete) - 4 commands\n\n### Phase 4: Fix Structural Issues\n\n1. **Remove auth.yaml from manifest** (or create stub if needed)\n2. **Consider CLI split** (lower priority - document recommendation only)\n\n## Deliverables\n\nThis plan produces **standalone tasks** - each can be worked independently:\n\n| Task | Description | Priority |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| Validate trait system E2E | Create test trait, verify inheritance works, clean up.
