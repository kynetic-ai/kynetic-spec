If there's an active (in_progress) task, continue that instead.\n\n2. **Start the task** (if not already in_progress):\n   ```bash\n   kspec task start @task-ref\n   ```\n\n3. **Do the work**:\n   - Read relevant files to understand the task\n   - Make changes as needed\n   - Run tests if applicable\n   - Document as you go with task notes\n\n4. **Document progress**:\n   ```bash\n   kspec task note @task-ref \"What you did, decisions made, etc.\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Submit or checkpoint**:\n   - If code is DONE (ready for PR):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task submit @task-ref\n     ```\n   - If task is NOT done (WIP):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task note @task-ref \"WIP: What's done, what remains...\"\n     ```\n\n6. **Commit your work**:\n   ```bash\n   git add -A && git commit -m \"feat/fix/chore: description\n\n   Task: @task-ref\"\n   ```\n\n7. **Reflect on this iteration**:\n   Think about what you learned, any friction points, or patterns worth remembering.\n\n   For **systemic patterns** (friction or success worth documenting):\n   ```bash\n   kspec meta observe friction \"Description of systemic issue...\"\n   kspec meta observe success \"Pattern worth replicating...\"\n   ```\n\n   For **actionable improvements** (specific ideas that could become tasks):\n   ```bash\n   kspec inbox add \"Improvement idea...\" --tag reflection\n   ```\n\n## Important Notes\n- Stay focused on ONE task per iteration\n- The loop continues automatically - don't worry about picking the next task\n- kspec tracks state across iterations via task status and notes\n- Always commit before the iteration ends\n- Always reflect and capture at least one observation\n","tasks":{"active":[],"ready":["01KFC1GKG","01KFBB5R","01KFBBTT","01KFBBXC","01KFBBZC","01KFBD5P","01KFBD9N","01KFBJCD","01KFBKK2","01KFBPQA"]}}}

If there's an active (in_progress) task, continue that instead.\n\n2. **Start the task** (if not already in_progress):\n   ```bash\n   kspec task start @task-ref\n   ```\n\n3. **Do the work**:\n   - Read relevant files to understand the task\n   - Make changes as needed\n   - Run tests if applicable\n   - Document as you go with task notes\n\n4. **Document progress**:\n   ```bash\n   kspec task note @task-ref \"What you did, decisions made, etc.\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Submit or checkpoint**:\n   - If code is DONE (ready for PR):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task submit @task-ref\n     ```\n   - If task is NOT done (WIP):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task note @task-ref \"WIP: What's done, what remains...\"\n     ```\n\n6. **Commit your work**:\n   ```bash\n   git add -A && git commit -m \"feat/fix/chore: description\n\n   Task: @task-ref\"\n   ```\n\n7. **Reflect on this iteration**:\n   Think about what you learned, any friction points, or patterns worth remembering.\n\n   For **systemic patterns** (friction or success worth documenting):\n   ```bash\n   kspec meta observe friction \"Description of systemic issue...\"\n   kspec meta observe success \"Pattern worth replicating...\"\n   ```\n\n   For **actionable improvements** (specific ideas that could become tasks):\n   ```bash\n   kspec inbox add \"Improvement idea...\" --tag reflection\n   ```\n\n## Important Notes\n- Stay focused on ONE task per iteration\n- The loop continues automatically - don't worry about picking the next task\n- kspec tracks state across iterations via task status and notes\n- Always commit before the iteration ends\n- Always reflect and capture at least one observation\n","tasks":{"active":[],"ready":["01KFBB5R","01KFBBTT","01KFBBXC","01KFBBZC","01KFBD5P","01KFBD9N","01KFBJCD","01KFBKK2","01KFBPQA","01KFBX5F"]}}}

It adds:\n- `trait` as a new item type to `ItemTypeSchema`\n- `traits` field to `SpecItemSchema` for referencing trait definitions\n- Updated all SpecItem construction sites to initialize the traits array\n\n### Scope Assessment\n\n**What this PR should implement (from @task-spec-traits-system):**\nThis is explicitly scoped as **foundation only**:\n1. Add 'trait' to ItemTypeSchema\n2. Add 'traits' field to SpecItemSchema\n3. Ensure tests pass\n\n**Child tasks handle:**\n- TraitIndex class\n- Display integration\n- Validation integration\n- CLI commands\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Coverage\n\nFrom the spec @spec-traits, the relevant ACs for this foundation PR are:\n\n#### @trait-type (01KFC19DEC50EQ9PBG2QWJV125)\n- **ac-1**: ✅ COVERED - Schema accepts `type: 'trait'` (verified via manual test)\n- **ac-2**: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE - Validation warning for trait without AC (child task)\n- **ac-3**: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE - Validation warning for trait without description (child task)\n- **ac-4**: ✅ COVERED - Non-trait items can have traits field (verified via manual test)\n\n#### @traits-field (01KFC1A9NA56A1RFAMZ5S0JPNA)\n- **ac-1**: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE - Refs must resolve to trait-type items (child task: validation)\n- **ac-2**: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE - Invalid ref validation (child task: validation)\n- **ac-3**: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE - Ref to non-trait validation (child task: validation)\n- **ac-4**: ✅ COVERED - Spec without traits field defaults to empty array (verified via manual test)\n- **ac-5**: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE - Duplicate trait warning (child task: validation)\n\n### Test Coverage Analysis\n\n#### Current Test Status\n- ✅ All 624 existing tests pass\n- ✅ No regressions introduced\n- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds\n\n#### AC Test Coverage\n**CRITICAL ISSUE: No tests exist for the foundation ACs**\n\nThe PR description states \"All 624 tests pass\" but there are **NO tests specifically validating the trait schema changes**.
