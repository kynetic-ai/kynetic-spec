Connects to daemon via REST API and WebSocket\nfor real-time updates. Includes WebSocketManager for connection resilience with exponential\nbackoff reconnection and sequence deduplication.\n\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- ac-1: Given daemon is running and browser opens localhost:3456, when page loads, then dashboard shows task overview with ready, in_progress, pending_review, blocked, completed counts\n- ac-2: Given dashboard is displayed, when task counts update on server, then counts animate to new values without page refresh (WebSocket-driven)\n- ac-3: Given dashboard is displayed, when user clicks a task count badge, then navigates to task list filtered by that status\n- ac-4: Given user is viewing task list, when list loads, then shows task title, status badge, priority indicator, spec_ref link, notes count\n- ac-5: Given user is viewing task list, when clicking a task row, then task detail panel opens showing description, notes (chronological), todos, dependencies\n- ac-6: Given user is viewing task detail, when task has spec_ref, then spec reference is clickable link to spec item detail\n- ac-7: Given user is viewing task detail, when user clicks Start Task button, then POST to /api/tasks/:ref/start, task status updates, UI reflects change\n- ac-8: Given user is viewing task detail, when user types in note textarea and clicks Add Note, then POST to /api/tasks/:ref/note, note appears in list\n- ac-9: Given user is viewing task list, when filter controls are visible, then can filter by status, type, tag, assignee, automation status\n- ac-10: Given user applies filter, when filter selection changes, then URL updates with query params, list updates without full reload\n- ac-11: Given user navigates to /items, when spec tree displays, then shows hierarchical tree with modules > features > requirements, expand/collapse\n- ac-12: Given user clicks spec item in tree, when item detail panel opens, then shows title, description, acceptance criteria (GWT format), traits, implementation status\n- ac-13: Given spec item has linked tasks, when viewing item detail, then Implementation section shows linked tasks with their status\n- ac-14: Given spec item has traits, when viewing item detail, then Traits section shows trait titles as chips, clickable to trait detail\n- ac-15: Given user clicks acceptance criterion, when AC row expands, then shows full Given/When/Then text with test coverage indicator if available\n- ac-16: Given user navigates to /inbox, when inbox list displays, then shows items ordered by created_at desc with text preview, tags, added_by\n- ac-17: Given user clicks Add button, when input field appears, then user can type text, press Enter to submit\n- ac-18: Given new inbox item submitted, when POST succeeds, then item appears at top of list with animation\n- ac-19: Given user clicks delete button on item, when confirmation appears, then on confirm, item removed from list\n- ac-20: Given dashboard header area, when session has focus set, then displays current focus text prominently\n- ac-21: Given dashboard sidebar, when observations exist, then shows unresolved observations count badge\n- ac-22: Given user clicks observations badge, when observations panel opens, then lists unresolved observations with type icons (friction/success/question/idea)\n- ac-23: Given user presses Cmd+K (or Ctrl+K), when command palette opens, then shows search input with placeholder\n- ac-24: Given user types in search box, when debounced search fires (300ms), then results show tasks, items, inbox matching query grouped by type\n- ac-25: Given search results display, when user clicks a result, then navigates to detail view for that item\n- ac-26: Given browser width < 768px, when viewing any page, then layout adapts to single column, sidebar becomes bottom nav\n- ac-27: Given browser width >= 1024px, when viewing detail panels, then detail panel opens as slide-over without navigating away from list\n- ac-28: Given WebSocket connection drops, when reconnect logic triggers, then automatic reconnect with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s... max 30s)\n- ac-29: Given WebSocket disconnected for >10s, when viewing dashboard, then Connection lost indicator shown\n- ac-30: Given events received via WebSocket, when seq <= lastSeqProcessed, then skip duplicate events (sequence deduplication)\n- ac-31: Given WebSocket reconnects, when connection established, then client resets lastSeqProcessed = -1 (server generates new sequence)\n- ac-32: Given WebSocket reconnects, when connection established, then client re-subscribes to all previous topics\n- ac-33: Given another client modifies task, when WebSocket update received, then task list/detail updates without refresh, subtle highlight animation on changed item"

      "closed_reason": "Daemon server mode fully implemented in packages/daemon/src with all 16 ACs covered. Complete with Elysia HTTP server, WebSocket pub/sub, file watching, heartbeat monitoring, graceful shutdown, PID management, and localhost-only security. Comprehensive test coverage with 61 AC annotations across daemon test files. All 1166 tests pass. No code changes needed - implementation was already complete from previous work."

Core idea: a script that runs Claude Code repeatedly with fresh context, using a templated prompt that instructs it to:\n\n1. Run 'kspec session start' to see ready tasks\n2. Pick a well-defined task (high priority, clear spec, no blockers)\n3. Work on it until completion or stuck\n4. Commit and complete the task\n5. Exit cleanly (the outer loop restarts with fresh context)\n\nKey features from research:\n- Simple core: while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done\n- Context persists via filesystem/git, not session memory\n- Dual-condition exit: require both completion indicator AND explicit exit signal\n- Circuit breaker: stop after N loops with no progress or repeated errors\n- Rate limiting for API calls\n\nKspec-specific additions:\n- Task selection heuristics (prioritize: clear AC, no blockers, isolated scope)\n- Progress tracking via task notes before each exit\n- Session checkpoint before exit to ensure clean state\n- Maybe: task budget (only attempt tasks under estimated N turns)\n\nThe beauty is each iteration starts fresh but inherits cumulative work. Bad iterations don't compound context - they just waste one run.",
