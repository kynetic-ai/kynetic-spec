Create WebSocket route with Elysia:\n   ```typescript\n   app.ws('/ws', {\n     open(ws) {\n       ws.data.sessionId = ulid();\n       ws.send({ event: 'connected', data: { session_id: ws.data.sessionId } });\n     },\n     message(ws, message) {\n       handleCommand(ws, JSON.parse(message));\n     },\n     close(ws) {\n       // Cleanup subscriptions\n     }\n   })\n   ```\n\n2. Implement command handling:\n   - subscribe: Track topics, send ack\n   - unsubscribe: Remove topics, send ack\n   - Other commands: Process and ack\n\n3. Implement heartbeat ping/pong (30s interval, 90s timeout)\n\n4. Implement backpressure handling (pause broadcasts on slow clients)\n\n### ACs Covered (from @api-contract)\n- ac-25: Connected event with session_id\n- ac-26: Command format\n- ac-27: Ack response\n- ac-28: Subscribe to topics\n- ac-29: Event format with seq\n- ac-30: Malformed command error\n- ac-31: Close codes\n- ac-32: Backpressure handling\n\n### ACs Covered (from @daemon-server)\n- ac-13: Heartbeat ping\n- ac-14: Timeout close\n\n### Files to Create\n- packages/daemon/src/websocket/handler.ts\n- packages/daemon/src/websocket/heartbeat.ts\n- packages/daemon/src/websocket/pubsub.ts\n- packages/daemon/src/websocket/types.ts"

Pick a well-defined task (high priority, clear spec, no blockers)\n3. Work on it until completion or stuck\n4. Commit and complete the task\n5.
