If there's an active (in_progress) task, continue that instead.\n\n2. **Start the task** (if not already in_progress):\n   ```bash\n   kspec task start @task-ref\n   ```\n\n3. **Do the work**:\n   - Read relevant files to understand the task\n   - Make changes as needed\n   - Run tests if applicable\n   - Document as you go with task notes\n\n4. **Document progress**:\n   ```bash\n   kspec task note @task-ref \"What you did, decisions made, etc.\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Submit or checkpoint**:\n   - If code is DONE (ready for PR):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task submit @task-ref\n     ```\n   - If task is NOT done (WIP):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task note @task-ref \"WIP: What's done, what remains...\"\n     ```\n\n6. **Commit your work**:\n   ```bash\n   git add -A && git commit -m \"feat/fix/chore: description\n\n   Task: @task-ref\"\n   ```\n\n7. **Reflect on this iteration**:\n   Think about what you learned, any friction points, or patterns worth remembering.\n\n   For **systemic patterns** (friction or success worth documenting):\n   ```bash\n   kspec meta observe friction \"Description of systemic issue...\"\n   kspec meta observe success \"Pattern worth replicating...\"\n   ```\n\n   For **actionable improvements** (specific ideas that could become tasks):\n   ```bash\n   kspec inbox add \"Improvement idea...\" --tag reflection\n   ```\n\n## Important Notes\n- Stay focused on ONE task per iteration\n- The loop continues automatically - don't worry about picking the next task\n- kspec tracks state across iterations via task status and notes\n- Always commit before the iteration ends\n- Always reflect and capture at least one observation\n","tasks":{"active":[],"ready":["01KFBBZC","01KFBD5P","01KFBD9N","01KFBJCD","01KFBPQA","01KFC3AR","01KFBBSK","01KFBDM8","01KFBDQE","01KFBDR7"]}}}
