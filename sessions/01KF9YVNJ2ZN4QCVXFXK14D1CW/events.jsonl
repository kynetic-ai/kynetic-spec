Pick a well-defined task (high priority, clear spec, no blockers)\\n3. Work on it until completion or stuck\\n4. Commit and complete the task\\n5.

Pick the highest priority task (lowest number = higher priority).

Pick a well-defined task (high priority, clear spec, no blockers)\\n3. Work on it until completion or stuck\\n4. Commit and complete the task\\n5. Exit cleanly (the outer loop restarts with fresh context)\\n\\nKey features from research:\\n- Simple core: while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done\\n- Context persists via filesystem/git, not session memory\\n- Dual-condition exit: require both completion indicator AND explicit exit signal\\n- Circuit breaker: stop after N loops with no progress or repeated errors\\n- Rate limiting for API calls\\n\\nKspec-specific additions:\\n- Task selection heuristics (prioritize: clear AC, no blockers, isolated scope)\\n- Progress tracking via task notes before each exit\\n- Session checkpoint before exit to ensure clean state\\n- Maybe: task budget (only attempt tasks under estimated N turns)\\n\\nThe beauty is each iteration starts fresh but inherits cumulative work.

Pick the highest priority task (lowest number = higher priority).

Core idea: a script that runs Claude Code repeatedly with fresh context, using a templated prompt that instructs it to:\\n\\n1. Run 'kspec session start' to see ready tasks\\n2. Pick a well-defined task (high priority, clear spec, no blockers)\\n3. Work on it until completion or stuck\\n4. Commit and complete the task\\n5. Exit cleanly (the outer loop restarts with fresh context)\\n\\nKey features from research:\\n- Simple core: while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done\\n- Context persists via filesystem/git, not session memory\\n- Dual-condition exit: require both completion indicator AND explicit exit signal\\n- Circuit breaker: stop after N loops with no progress or repeated errors\\n- Rate limiting for API calls\\n\\nKspec-specific additions:\\n- Task selection heuristics (prioritize: clear AC, no blockers, isolated scope)\\n- Progress tracking via task notes before each exit\\n- Session checkpoint before exit to ensure clean state\\n- Maybe: task budget (only attempt tasks under estimated N turns)\\n\\nThe beauty is each iteration starts fresh but inherits cumulative work. Bad iterations don't compound context - they just waste one run.\",\n      \"created_at\": \"2026-01-17T04:59:17.160Z\",\n      \"tags\": [\n        \"automation\",\n        \"workflow\",\n        \"agents\"\n      ],\n      \"added_by\": \"@claude\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"ref\": \"01KF6541\",\n      \"text\": \"Ralph TUI mode: Optional terminal UI for ralph that provides real-time visualization of agent progress, event stream, session status.

Pick the highest priority task (lowest number = higher priority). If there's an active (in_progress) task, continue that instead.\n\n2. **Start the task** (if not already in_progress):\n   ```bash\n   kspec task start @task-ref\n   ```\n\n3. **Do the work**:\n   - Read relevant files to understand the task\n   - Make changes as needed\n   - Run tests if applicable\n   - Document as you go with task notes\n\n4. **Document progress**:\n   ```bash\n   kspec task note @task-ref \"What you did, decisions made, etc.\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Complete or checkpoint**:\n   - If task is DONE:\n     ```bash\n     kspec task complete @task-ref --reason \"Summary of completion\"\n     ```\n   - If task is NOT done (WIP):\n     ```bash\n     kspec task note @task-ref \"WIP: What's done, what remains...\"\n     ```\n\n6. **Commit your work**:\n   ```bash\n   git add -A && git commit -m \"feat/fix/chore: description\n\n   Task: @task-ref\"\n   ```\n\n7. **Reflect on this iteration**:\n   Think about what you learned, any friction points, or patterns worth remembering.\n\n   For **systemic patterns** (friction or success worth documenting):\n   ```bash\n   kspec meta observe friction \"Description of systemic issue...\"\n   kspec meta observe success \"Pattern worth replicating...\"\n   ```\n\n   For **actionable improvements** (specific ideas that could become tasks):\n   ```bash\n   kspec inbox add \"Improvement idea...\" --tag reflection\n   ```\n\n## Important Notes\n- Stay focused on ONE task per iteration\n- The loop continues automatically - don't worry about picking the next task\n- kspec tracks state across iterations via task status and notes\n- Always commit before the iteration ends\n- Always reflect and capture at least one observation\n","tasks":{"active":[],"ready":["01KF9B4S","01KF9B4W","01KF9B4Y","01KF9C1E","01KF9Q16","01KF9QKK","01KF4WVX2","01KF9B3Y","01KF9B41","01KF9B44"]}}}

Pick a well-defined task (high priority, clear spec, no blockers)\\n3. Work on it until completion or stuck\\n4. Commit and complete the task\\n5.
