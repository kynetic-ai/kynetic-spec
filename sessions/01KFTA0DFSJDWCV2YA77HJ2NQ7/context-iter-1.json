However, the actual PidFileManager implementation (packages/daemon/src/pid.ts) does NOT implement file locking.

Write a documentary test with test.skip() showing what SHOULD work\n2. Block this task until AC-10b is implemented in the PidFileManager\n3. Implement both the file locking AND the test (scope expansion)\n\nChecking if file locking is actually implemented elsewhere or if AC-10b spec needs revision."

Core idea: a script that runs Claude Code repeatedly with fresh context, using a templated prompt that instructs it to:\n\n1. Run 'kspec session start' to see ready tasks\n2. Pick a well-defined task (high priority, clear spec, no blockers)\n3. Work on it until completion or stuck\n4. Commit and complete the task\n5. Exit cleanly (the outer loop restarts with fresh context)\n\nKey features from research:\n- Simple core: while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done\n- Context persists via filesystem/git, not session memory\n- Dual-condition exit: require both completion indicator AND explicit exit signal\n- Circuit breaker: stop after N loops with no progress or repeated errors\n- Rate limiting for API calls\n\nKspec-specific additions:\n- Task selection heuristics (prioritize: clear AC, no blockers, isolated scope)\n- Progress tracking via task notes before each exit\n- Session checkpoint before exit to ensure clean state\n- Maybe: task budget (only attempt tasks under estimated N turns)\n\nThe beauty is each iteration starts fresh but inherits cumulative work. Bad iterations don't compound context - they just waste one run.",

Maybe simpler approach: explicit 'kspec bulk' command that takes a script/list of operations and executes them atomically.",
