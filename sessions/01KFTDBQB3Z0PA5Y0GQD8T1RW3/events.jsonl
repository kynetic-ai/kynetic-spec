Creating test-first implementation with mock class to validate expected behavior. Will cover ACs 1-8, 14-16, 20, focusing on:\n- Project registration and caching\n- Path validation and normalization  \n- Default project handling\n- Concurrent registration\n- Invalid project detection\n[2026-01-24T18:32:26.665Z] @claude:\nAnalysis complete. ProjectContextManager unit tests require:\n\n1. Mock class implementing core manager API:\n   - registerProject(path): validates, normalizes, caches project context\n   - getProject(path): retrieves cached context\n   - setDefaultProject(path): sets fallback for requests without X-Kspec-Dir\n   - hasProject(path): checks registration status\n   - unregisterProject(path): removes from cache\n   - listProjects(): returns all registered projects\n2. Test coverage areas (30+ tests needed):\n   - Path validation (AC-5, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-8b, AC-8c)\n   - Registration/caching (AC-1, AC-4, AC-14, AC-16)\n   - Default project (AC-2, AC-3, AC-20b)\n   - Auto-unregister on deletion (AC-20)\n   - Concurrent registration race (AC-16)\n3.

Create tests/daemon-context-manager.test.ts\n2. Implement mock ProjectContextManager class with API:\n   - registerProject(path, isDefault?): validates + caches\n   - getProject(path): retrieves cached context\n   - setDefaultProject(path): sets fallback\n   - hasProject(path): check registration\n   - unregisterProject(path): remove from cache\n   - listProjects(): return all registered\n3.
