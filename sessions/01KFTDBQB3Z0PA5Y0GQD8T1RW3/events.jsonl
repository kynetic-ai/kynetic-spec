Creating test-first implementation with mock class to validate expected behavior. Will cover ACs 1-8, 14-16, 20, focusing on:\n- Project registration and caching\n- Path validation and normalization  \n- Default project handling\n- Concurrent registration\n- Invalid project detection\n[2026-01-24T18:32:26.665Z] @claude:\nAnalysis complete. ProjectContextManager unit tests require:\n\n1. Mock class implementing core manager API:\n   - registerProject(path): validates, normalizes, caches project context\n   - getProject(path): retrieves cached context\n   - setDefaultProject(path): sets fallback for requests without X-Kspec-Dir\n   - hasProject(path): checks registration status\n   - unregisterProject(path): removes from cache\n   - listProjects(): returns all registered projects\n2. Test coverage areas (30+ tests needed):\n   - Path validation (AC-5, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-8b, AC-8c)\n   - Registration/caching (AC-1, AC-4, AC-14, AC-16)\n   - Default project (AC-2, AC-3, AC-20b)\n   - Auto-unregister on deletion (AC-20)\n   - Concurrent registration race (AC-16)\n3.

Projects are identified via X-Kspec-Dir HTTP header. Enables E2E testing\n  with isolated fixtures and multi-project development workflows.\n  \n  Key architectural changes:\n  - Global daemon with PID/port files at ~/.config/kspec/\n  - Project context caching with on-demand registration\n  - Per-project file watchers\n  - WebSocket connections bound to specific projects\n  \n  BREAKING CHANGE: PID/port files move from .kspec/.daemon.pid to ~/.config/kspec/daemon.pid\nAcceptance Criteria:\n  [ac-1]\n    Given: daemon is running\n    When: request includes X-Kspec-Dir header with valid absolute path\n    Then: daemon uses that project's context for the request\n  [ac-2]\n    Given: daemon started from directory with .kspec/\n    When: request has no X-Kspec-Dir header\n    Then: daemon uses startup directory's project as default\n  [ac-3]\n    Given: daemon started from directory without .kspec/\n    When: request without X-Kspec-Dir arrives\n    Then: return 400 with error \"No default project configured.

This task requires: (1) Run tests and verify they pass, (2) Verify AC coverage, (3) Fix any gaps in WebSocket binding tests.\n\n─── Inherited from @trait-localhost-security ───\n  [ac-1] (from @trait-localhost-security)\n    Given: server is starting\n    When: binding to network interface\n    Then: only accepts connections from 127.0.0.1 and ::1 (IPv6 localhost)\n  [ac-2] (from @trait-localhost-security)\n    Given: connection attempt from non-localhost\n    When: request received\n    Then: connection rejected with 403 Forbidden\n  [ac-3] (from @trait-localhost-security)\n    Given: server is configured\n    When: configuration allows external binding\n    Then: warning displayed about security implications\n\n─── Inherited from @trait-websocket-protocol ───\n  [ac-1] (from @trait-websocket-protocol)\n    Given: WebSocket connection is established\n    When: client connects\n    Then: server assigns unique connection ID and sends connected event with session_id\n  [ac-2] (from @trait-websocket-protocol)\n    Given: client wants notifications\n    When: subscribe command sent with topics array\n    Then: server tracks subscription and sends ack with request_id\n  [ac-3] (from @trait-websocket-protocol)\n    Given: client is subscribed to topic\n    When: relevant change occurs\n    Then: server broadcasts event with format {msg_id, seq, timestamp, topic, event, data}\n  [ac-4] (from @trait-websocket-protocol)\n    Given: WebSocket connection is active\n    When: 30 seconds pass without activity\n    Then: server sends ping frame\n  [ac-5] (from @trait-websocket-protocol)\n    Given: ping was sent\n    When: no pong received within 90 seconds\n    Then: connection is closed with code 1001\n  [ac-6] (from @trait-websocket-protocol)\n    Given: server sends events\n    When: client cannot keep up (backpressure)\n    Then: server pauses non-critical broadcasts until drain event\n  [ac-7] (from @trait-websocket-protocol)\n    Given: connection is closing\n    When: close initiated\n    Then: use code 1000 for clean close, 1001 for timeout, 1011 for error\n  [ac-8] (from @trait-websocket-protocol)\n    Given: client reconnects after disconnect\n    When: new connection established\n    Then: client resets sequence tracking (lastSeqProcessed = -1) since server generates new sequence"}}]}}}

--format json', then writes kspec-snapshot.json containing all tasks, items, inbox, meta to stdout or --output path\\n- ac-2: Given export runs, when output is generated, then JSON includes exported_at timestamp, version (kspec version), project metadata\\n- ac-3: Given export runs, when tasks are included, then each task includes resolved spec_ref title (not just ref string) for display without resolution\\n- ac-4: Given export runs, when items are included, then hierarchical structure preserved, acceptance_criteria expanded, traits resolved to include inherited ACs\\n- ac-5: Given export runs with --include-validation, when validation is run, then JSON includes validation block with error/warning counts and details\\n- ac-6: Given kspec is installed, when user runs 'kspec export --format html', then generates self-contained HTML file with embedded JSON and SPA code\\n- ac-7: Given kspec is installed, when user runs 'kspec export --dry-run', then shows what would be exported without writing files\\n- ac-8: Given push to kspec-meta branch, when CI workflow triggers, then runs kspec export, commits to gh-pages branch\\n- ac-9: Given CI workflow runs, when SPA assets don't exist, then copies SPA static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) to docs/ alongside JSON\\n- ac-10: Given rapid commits to kspec-meta, when multiple pushes within 30 seconds, then CI debounces and runs once with latest state\\n- ac-11: Given user opens gh-pages URL, when SPA loads, then fetches kspec-snapshot.json from same origin, renders dashboard\\n- ac-12: Given user navigates to /tasks/@task-slug, when deep link resolves, then SPA parses path (history API), shows task detail for that ref\\n- ac-13: Given user navigates to /items/@spec-slug, when deep link resolves, then SPA shows spec item detail for that ref\\n- ac-14: Given SPA renders, when validation data present in snapshot, then shows validation summary badge (green check or red X with count)\\n- ac-15: Given

Cards are clickable and navigate to filtered task list\\n   - Uses WebSocket subscription for real-time updates\\n\\n2. **Created E2E test file** (packages/web-ui/tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts):\\n   - Tests for ac-1 (task counts display)\\n   - Tests for ac-2 (real-time WebSocket updates)\\n   - Tests for ac-3 (click navigation to filtered list)\\n   - Tests for ac-20 (session focus display)\\n   - Tests for ac-21 (observations badge)\\n   - Viewport tests for mobile/desktop layouts\\n\\n3. **Fixed CORS configuration** (packages/daemon/src/server.ts):\\n   - Changed from hardcoded port list to dynamic localhost origin matching\\n\\n4. **Fixed same-origin API architecture**:\\n   - Updated api.ts to use getApiBase() that returns current window.location.origin\\n   - Updated WebSocket manager to derive URL from window.location\\n   - Updated Playwright config to use daemon port 3456 (not separate preview server)\\n   - Test fixture now passes WEB_UI_DIR env var to daemon\\n\\n5. **Fixed daemon project root issue** (packages/daemon/src/server.ts):\\n   - Daemon was passing .kspec/ path to initContext() which triggered 'running from shadow' error\\n   - Fixed by deriving projectRoot = join(kspecDir, '..')\\n\\n### Blockers Encountered\\n1. **Static asset serving mismatch**: \\n   - Error: 'Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: start.DimW3LEi.js'\\n   - Actual file: start.DMRz5srh.js (different hash)\\n   - The daemon is serving HTML that references old asset hashes\\n   - Root cause: uncertain - possibly caching issue or multiple web UI builds\\n\\n2. **Environment variable propagation**:\\n   - WEB_UI_DIR is set in test fixture when spawning kspec CLI\\n   - Not verified if it propagates through kspec -> daemon spawn chain\\n\\n### Files Modified\\n- packages/web-ui/src/routes/+page.svelte (dashboard UI)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/api.ts (TaskCounts, fetchTaskCounts, getApiBase)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/websocket/manager.ts (dynamic WS URL)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/components/Sidebar.svelte (observations-badge testid)\\n- packages/web-ui/tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts (new test file)\\n- packages/web-ui/tests/fixtures/test-base.ts (WEB_UI_DIR env var)\\n- packages/web-ui/playwright.config.ts (use daemon port 3456, no webServer)\\n- packages/daemon/src/server.ts (CORS fix, projectRoot derivation)\\n\\n### Next Steps for Resolution\\n1. Debug why daemon serves stale HTML with old asset hashes:\\n   - Check if staticPlugin caches index.html\\n   - Verify WEB_UI_DIR is being read correctly by daemon\\n   - Try adding console.log in resolveWebUiPath() to trace what path is used\\n\\n2. Consider alternative approach:\\n   - Have test fixture copy web UI build to temp directory\\n   - Or symlink the build directory\\n\\n3. Once static serving works, tests should pass - the logic is correct\\n\\n### Key Insight\\nThe E2E test architecture should be: single daemon on port 3456 serving both static assets and API. No need for separate Vite preview server.

Cards are clickable and navigate to filtered task list\\n   - Uses WebSocket subscription for real-time updates\\n\\n2. **Created E2E test file** (packages/web-ui/tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts):\\n   - Tests for ac-1 (task counts display)\\n   - Tests for ac-2 (real-time WebSocket updates)\\n   - Tests for ac-3 (click navigation to filtered list)\\n   - Tests for ac-20 (session focus display)\\n   - Tests for ac-21 (observations badge)\\n   - Viewport tests for mobile/desktop layouts\\n\\n3. **Fixed CORS configuration** (packages/daemon/src/server.ts):\\n   - Changed from hardcoded port list to dynamic localhost origin matching\\n\\n4. **Fixed same-origin API architecture**:\\n   - Updated api.ts to use getApiBase() that returns current window.location.origin\\n   - Updated WebSocket manager to derive URL from window.location\\n   - Updated Playwright config to use daemon port 3456 (not separate preview server)\\n   - Test fixture now passes WEB_UI_DIR env var to daemon\\n\\n5. **Fixed daemon project root issue** (packages/daemon/src/server.ts):\\n   - Daemon was passing .kspec/ path to initContext() which triggered 'running from shadow' error\\n   - Fixed by deriving projectRoot = join(kspecDir, '..')\\n\\n### Blockers Encountered\\n1. **Static asset serving mismatch**: \\n   - Error: 'Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: start.DimW3LEi.js'\\n   - Actual file: start.DMRz5srh.js (different hash)\\n   - The daemon is serving HTML that references old asset hashes\\n   - Root cause: uncertain - possibly caching issue or multiple web UI builds\\n\\n2. **Environment variable propagation**:\\n   - WEB_UI_DIR is set in test fixture when spawning kspec CLI\\n   - Not verified if it propagates through kspec -> daemon spawn chain\\n\\n### Files Modified\\n- packages/web-ui/src/routes/+page.svelte (dashboard UI)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/api.ts (TaskCounts, fetchTaskCounts, getApiBase)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/websocket/manager.ts (dynamic WS URL)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/components/Sidebar.svelte (observations-badge testid)\\n- packages/web-ui/tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts (new test file)\\n- packages/web-ui/tests/fixtures/test-base.ts (WEB_UI_DIR env var)\\n- packages/web-ui/playwright.config.ts (use daemon port 3456, no webServer)\\n- packages/daemon/src/server.ts (CORS fix, projectRoot derivation)\\n\\n### Next Steps for Resolution\\n1. Debug why daemon serves stale HTML with old asset hashes:\\n   - Check if staticPlugin caches index.html\\n   - Verify WEB_UI_DIR is being read correctly by daemon\\n   - Try adding console.log in resolveWebUiPath() to trace what path is used\\n\\n2. Consider alternative approach:\\n   - Have test fixture copy web UI build to temp directory\\n   - Or symlink the build directory\\n\\n3. Once static serving works, tests should pass - the logic is correct\\n\\n### Key Insight\\nThe E2E test architecture should be: single daemon on port 3456 serving both static assets and API. No need for separate Vite preview server.

Progress Report\\n\\n### Work Done\\n1. **Created dashboard UI** (packages/web-ui/src/routes/+page.svelte):\\n   - Added TaskCounts interface and fetchTaskCounts() API function\\n   - Dashboard displays task summary cards by status (pending, in_progress, pending_review, blocked, completed)\\n   - Cards are clickable and navigate to filtered task list\\n   - Uses WebSocket subscription for real-time updates\\n\\n2. **Created E2E test file** (packages/web-ui/tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts):\\n   - Tests for ac-1 (task counts display)\\n   - Tests for ac-2 (real-time WebSocket updates)\\n   - Tests for ac-3 (click navigation to filtered list)\\n   - Tests for ac-20 (session focus display)\\n   - Tests for ac-21 (observations badge)\\n   - Viewport tests for mobile/desktop layouts\\n\\n3. **Fixed CORS configuration** (packages/daemon/src/server.ts):\\n   - Changed from hardcoded port list to dynamic localhost origin matching\\n\\n4. **Fixed same-origin API architecture**:\\n   - Updated api.ts to use getApiBase() that returns current window.location.origin\\n   - Updated WebSocket manager to derive URL from window.location\\n   - Updated Playwright config to use daemon port 3456 (not separate preview server)\\n   - Test fixture now passes WEB_UI_DIR env var to daemon\\n\\n5. **Fixed daemon project root issue** (packages/daemon/src/server.ts):\\n   - Daemon was passing .kspec/ path to initContext() which triggered 'running from shadow' error\\n   - Fixed by deriving projectRoot = join(kspecDir, '..')\\n\\n### Blockers Encountered\\n1. **Static asset serving mismatch**: \\n   - Error: 'Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: start.DimW3LEi.js'\\n   - Actual file: start.DMRz5srh.js (different hash)\\n   - The daemon is serving HTML that references old asset hashes\\n   - Root cause: uncertain - possibly caching issue or multiple web UI builds\\n\\n2. **Environment variable propagation**:\\n   - WEB_UI_DIR is set in test fixture when spawning kspec CLI\\n   - Not verified if it propagates through kspec -> daemon spawn chain\\n\\n### Files Modified\\n- packages/web-ui/src/routes/+page.svelte (dashboard UI)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/api.ts (TaskCounts, fetchTaskCounts, getApiBase)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/websocket/manager.ts (dynamic WS URL)\\n- packages/web-ui/src/lib/components/Sidebar.svelte (observations-badge testid)\\n- packages/web-ui/tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts (new test file)\\n- packages/web-ui/tests/fixtures/test-base.ts (WEB_UI_DIR env var)\\n- packages/web-ui/playwright.config.ts (use daemon port 3456, no webServer)\\n- packages/daemon/src/server.ts (CORS fix, projectRoot derivation)\\n\\n### Next Steps for Resolution\\n1. Debug why daemon serves stale HTML with old asset hashes:\\n   - Check if staticPlugin caches index.html\\n   - Verify WEB_UI_DIR is being read correctly by daemon\\n   - Try adding console.log in resolveWebUiPath() to trace what path is used\\n\\n2. Consider alternative approach:\\n   - Have test fixture copy web UI build to temp directory\\n   - Or symlink the build directory\\n\\n3. Once static serving works, tests should pass - the logic is correct\\n\\n### Key Insight\\nThe E2E test architecture should be: single daemon on port 3456 serving both static assets and API. No need for separate Vite preview server. This simplifies CORS and is how production works.\",\n   106→        \"supersedes\": null\n   107→      },\n   108→      {\n   109→        \"_ulid\": \"01KFQ5ANAC3J958039PM4SG7ZZ\",\n   110→        \"created_at\": \"2026-01-24T04:48:48.460Z\",\n   111→        \"author\": \"@claude\",\n   112→        \"content\": \"## Session End Status\\n\\nTask remains in_progress - tests not yet passing.\\n\\n**Immediate blocker:** Static asset hash mismatch - daemon serves HTML with old asset references.\\n\\n**Branch:** feat/e2e-dashboard-tests (committed)\\n\\n**Next session should:**\\n1. Debug resolveWebUiPath() - add logging to trace which path is used\\n2. Verify WEB_UI_DIR env var propagates to daemon subprocess\\n3.

submitted\n    When: POST succeeds\n    Then: item appears at top of list with animation\n  [ac-19]\n    Given: user clicks delete button on item\n    When: confirmation appears\n    Then: on confirm, item removed from list\n  [ac-20]\n    Given: dashboard header area\n    When: session has focus set\n    Then: displays current focus text prominently\n  [ac-21]\n    Given: dashboard sidebar\n    When: observations exist\n    Then: shows unresolved observations count badge\n  [ac-22]\n    Given: user clicks observations badge\n    When: observations panel opens\n    Then: lists unresolved observations with type icons (friction/success/question/idea)\n  [ac-23]\n    Given: user presses Cmd+K (or Ctrl+K)\n    When: command palette opens\n    Then: shows search input with placeholder\n  [ac-24]\n    Given: user types in search box\n    When: debounced search fires (300ms)\n    Then: results show tasks, items, inbox matching query grouped by type\n  [ac-25]\n    Given: search results display\n    When: user clicks a result\n    Then: navigates to detail view for that item\n  [ac-26]\n    Given: browser width < 768px\n    When: viewing any page\n    Then: layout adapts to single column, sidebar becomes bottom nav\n  [ac-27]\n    Given: browser width >= 1024px\n    When: viewing detail panels\n    Then: detail panel opens as slide-over without navigating away from list\n  [ac-28]\n    Given: WebSocket connection drops\n    When: reconnect logic triggers\n    Then: automatic reconnect with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s... max 30s)\n  [ac-29]\n    Given: WebSocket disconnected for >10s\n    When: viewing dashboard\n    Then: Connection lost indicator shown\n  [ac-30]\n    Given: events received via WebSocket\n    When: seq <= lastSeqProcessed\n    Then: skip duplicate events (sequence deduplication)\n  [ac-31]\n    Given: WebSocket reconnects\n    When: connection established\n    Then: client resets lastSeqProcessed = -1 (server generates new sequence)\n  [ac-32]\n    Given: WebSocket reconnects\n    When: connection established\n    Then: client re-subscribes to all previous topics\n  [ac-33]\n    Given: another client modifies task\n    When: WebSocket update received\n    Then: task list/detail updates without refresh, subtle highlight animation on changed item\n\n─── Notes ───\n[2026-01-23T20:19:51.791Z] @claude:\n## Objective\nWrite E2E

generation from kspec state for hosting read-only views on GitHub Pages.\nCI workflow builds JSON snapshot from shadow branch on push, SPA reads this JSON for rendering.\nEnables deep linking to tasks/specs from PRs and issues with data freshness indicator.\n\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- ac-1: Given kspec is installed, when user runs 'kspec export --format json', then writes kspec-snapshot.json containing all tasks, items, inbox, meta to stdout or --output path\n- ac-2: Given export runs, when output is generated, then JSON includes exported_at timestamp, version (kspec version), project metadata\n- ac-3: Given export runs, when tasks are included, then each task includes resolved spec_ref title (not just ref string) for display without resolution\n- ac-4: Given export runs, when items are included, then hierarchical structure preserved, acceptance_criteria expanded, traits resolved to include inherited ACs\n- ac-5: Given export runs with --include-validation, when validation is run, then JSON includes validation block with error/warning counts and details\n- ac-6: Given kspec is installed, when user runs 'kspec export --format html', then generates self-contained HTML file with embedded JSON and SPA code\n- ac-7: Given kspec is installed, when user runs 'kspec export --dry-run', then shows what would be exported without writing files\n- ac-8: Given push to

CSS) to docs/ alongside JSON\n- ac-10: Given rapid commits to kspec-meta, when multiple pushes within 30 seconds, then CI debounces and runs once with latest state\n- ac-11: Given user opens gh-pages URL, when SPA loads, then fetches kspec-snapshot.json from same origin, renders dashboard\n- ac-12: Given user navigates to /tasks/@task-slug, when deep link resolves, then SPA parses path (history API), shows task detail for that ref\n- ac-13: Given user navigates to /items/@spec-slug, when deep link resolves, then SPA shows spec item detail for that ref\n- ac-14: Given SPA renders, when

Connects to daemon via REST API and WebSocket\nfor real-time updates. Includes WebSocketManager for connection resilience with exponential\nbackoff reconnection and sequence deduplication.\n\n\nAcceptance Criteria (33):\n  [ac-1]\n    Given: daemon is running on configured port (default 3456)\n    When: browser opens the daemon URL\n    Then: dashboard shows task overview with ready, in_progress, pending_review, blocked, completed counts\n  [ac-2]\n    Given: dashboard is displayed\n    When: task counts update on server\n    Then: counts animate to new values without page refresh (WebSocket-driven)\n  [ac-3]\n    Given: dashboard is displayed\n    When: user clicks a task count badge\n    Then: navigates to task list filtered by that status\n  [ac-4]\n    Given: user is viewing task list\n    When: list loads\n    Then: shows task title, status badge, priority indicator, spec_ref link, notes count\n  [ac-5]\n    Given: user is viewing task list\n    When: clicking a task row\n    Then: task detail panel opens showing description, notes (chronological), todos, dependencies\n  [ac-6]\n    Given: user is viewing task detail\n    When: task has spec_ref\n    Then: spec reference is clickable link to spec item detail\n  [ac-7]\n    Given: user is viewing task detail\n    When: user clicks Start Task button\n    Then: POST to /api/tasks/:ref/start, task status updates, UI reflects change\n  [ac-8]\n    Given: user is viewing task detail\n    When: user types in note textarea and clicks Add Note\n    Then: POST to /api/tasks/:ref/note, note appears in list\n  [ac-9]\n    Given: user is viewing task list\n    When: filter controls are visible\n    Then: can filter by status, type, tag, assignee, automation status\n  [ac-10]\n    Given: user applies filter\n    When: filter selection changes\n    Then: URL updates with query params, list updates without full reload\n  [ac-11]\n    Given: user navigates to /items\n    When: spec tree displays\n    Then: shows hierarchical tree with modules > features > requirements, expand/collapse\n  [ac-12]\n    Given: user clicks spec item in tree\n    When: item detail panel opens\n    Then: shows title, description, acceptance criteria (GWT format), traits, implementation status\n  [ac-13]\n    Given: spec item has linked tasks\n    When: viewing item detail\n    Then: Implementation section shows linked tasks with their status\n  [ac-14]\n    Given: spec item has

panel opens\n    Then: lists unresolved observations with type icons (friction/success/question/idea)\n  [ac-23]\n    Given: user presses Cmd+K (or Ctrl+K)\n    When: command palette opens\n    Then: shows search input with placeholder\n  [ac-24]\n    Given: user types in search box\n    When: debounced search fires (300ms)\n    Then: results show tasks, items, inbox matching query grouped by type\n  [ac-25]\n    Given: search results display\n    When: user clicks a result\n    Then: navigates to detail view for that item\n  [ac-26]\n    Given: browser width < 768px\n    When: viewing any
