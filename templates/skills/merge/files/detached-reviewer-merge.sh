# Detached Reviewer Merge Helper
#
# Merges the reviewed canonical branch into the integration target from a
# detached reviewer snapshot. This is the one supported merge path for
# reviewers in manual_merge publication mode.
#
# Required dispatch environment variables:
#   KSPEC_DISPATCH_CANONICAL_BRANCH  — the task branch to merge
#   KSPEC_DISPATCH_MERGE_TARGET      — the integration branch name (e.g. "dev")
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — merge succeeded (or no-op: already integrated)
#   1  — error (missing env, dirty target, conflict, etc.)
