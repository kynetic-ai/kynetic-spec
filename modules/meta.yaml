# Meta-Spec Module - Process Definition System
# Defines how agents work on projects, enabling self-improvement loops
#
# Key insight: Just as tasks track work on spec items, meta-tasks can track
# work on meta items. This creates a reflexive loop where agents can improve
# their own workflows based on observed friction and success patterns.

  Meta-spec is the layer that defines HOW work happens, separate from
  WHAT is being built (spec) and tracking WORK (tasks).

  The key distinction:
  - Spec: What to build (features, requirements)
  - Tasks: Work to do (implement feature X)
  - Meta-spec: How to work (check spec before implementing)

  Meta-spec enables a self-improvement loop:
  1. Define workflows → 2. Track adherence → 3. Identify friction →
  4. Propose improvements → 5. Update workflows → (repeat)

  Meta-spec complements prose docs (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) rather than
  replacing them. Structured definitions + prose guidance work together.

      The meta manifest (kynetic.meta.yaml) is the root file for process
      definitions. It lives alongside kynetic.yaml and defines agents,
      workflows, conventions, and observations.

      Unlike spec items which define product features, meta items define
      how work is done on the project.

      Session context is ephemeral state tracking current focus,
      active threads, and open questions. Unlike other meta items,
      context is dynamic and stored in a separate file (.kspec-session)
      that can be gitignored.

      Context helps with session continuity and handoff between agents.

          Context is stored in .kspec-session:

          - Separate from meta manifest (ephemeral vs stable)
          - Gitignored by default (session-specific)
          - Auto-created when context commands used
          - Can be deleted without losing project configuration

          This keeps project-level meta (agents, workflows) separate
          from session-level state (focus, threads).
