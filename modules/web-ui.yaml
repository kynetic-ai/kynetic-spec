    acceptance_criteria:
      - id: ac-1
        given: kspec is installed
        when: user runs 'kspec serve'
        then: HTTP server starts on configurable port (default 3456) and serves API endpoints
      - id: ac-2
        given: daemon is running
        when: any .kspec/*.yaml file changes
        then: connected clients receive SSE update within 200ms
      - id: ac-3
        given: daemon is running
        when: user runs 'kspec serve --daemon'
        then: process detaches to background, writes PID file, and CLI returns immediately
      - id: ac-4
        given: daemon is running in background
        when: user runs 'kspec serve stop'
        then: daemon shuts down gracefully, removes PID file, and closes all connections
      - id: ac-5
        given: daemon is running
        when: GET /api/tasks is called
        then: returns JSON array of all tasks with status, notes, and dependencies
      - id: ac-6
        given: daemon is running
        when: POST /api/tasks/:ref/start is called
        then: task transitions to in_progress and SSE broadcasts update
