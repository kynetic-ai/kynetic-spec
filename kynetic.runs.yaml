          What worked well:
          1. Subagent exploration gave comprehensive overview quickly
          2. Systematic testing of each feature area (session context, observations, workflow runs)
          3. workflow next auto-inferring active run - reduced command verbosity
          4. Multiline step content works in YAML - enables rich guidance

          Friction points identified:
          1. No --steps flag on 'meta add workflow' - had to manually edit YAML
          2. 'workflow show' requires run-ref even when only one active run (unlike next)
          3. --input flags silently ignored when step has no defined inputs - could confuse users
          4. cwd issue after 'cd .kspec && git commit' - easy to forget to cd back

          Proposed improvements:

          1. Add --steps flag to 'meta add workflow' (scope: small) - Allow defining steps at
          creation time using JSON array

          2. Make 'workflow show' infer active run like 'workflow next' (scope: small) -
          Consistency, less typing

          3. Warn when --input passed but step has no inputs defined (scope: small) - Prevent
          confusion

          Designed 8 steps for pr-review-merge workflow:


          1. [action] Create PR with implementation - kspec /pr or gh pr create

          2. [check] All CI checks pass - on_fail: Wait for CI, fix failures

          3. [action] Read review comments - Check automated review output

          4. [check] All review issues addressed - on_fail: Fix issues, push, re-run CI

          5. [action] Check for user @claude comments - Look for requests the PR agent couldn't
          complete

          6. [check] All pending actions completed - on_fail: Complete actions yourself before
          merging

          7. [check] All review threads resolved - on_fail: Click Resolve conversation on each
          thread

          8. [action] Merge PR - gh pr merge or GitHub UI


          This follows the Gate Pattern with multiple checks between actions.

          Designed 6 steps for local-review workflow:


          1. [action] Get spec reference and read ACs - input: spec_ref

          2. [check] Every AC has test coverage with // AC: annotation - on_fail: MUST-FIX, list
          missing ACs

          3. [check] All tests validate real behavior (no fluff tests) - on_fail: MUST-FIX, reject
          tests that always pass

          4. [check] Test strategy prefers E2E over unit tests - on_fail: Consider adding E2E tests
          for CLI functionality

          5. [check] Tests run in temp directories (not kspec repo) - on_fail: MUST-FIX, prevents
          nested worktree issues

          6. [action] Report findings - list all MUST-FIX issues


          Uses Gate pattern with strict checks. Input captures spec for traceability.

          What worked well this session:


          1. **Trait-based approach for cross-cutting behavior** - User's insight that traits aren't
          just for user-facing behavior but for any cross-cutting concern was key. Creating
          @trait-shadow-commit with explicit AC now makes the implicit shadow commit behavior
          testable and documented.


          2. **Subagent exploration before planning** - Using Explore agents to map ALL shadow write
          locations and a Plan agent to review for gaps caught 6 additional missing commits beyond
          the initial 4 identified. This thorough exploration prevented incomplete fixes.


          3. **Spec-first implementation** - Created the trait spec, added to command specs, THEN
          fixed the code. This ensures the spec is the source of truth and AC annotations in code
          reference back to spec.


          4. **kspec CLI for spec changes** - Using 'kspec item trait add' to add traits was much
          cleaner than manually editing YAML.


          5. **Clear design decision documentation** - Explicitly documenting that session context
          is NOT committed (transient state) prevents future confusion about why those commands
          don't have the trait.

          Friction points this session:


          1. **YAML quoting issues** - When adding the trait, the AC text 'message follows format
          "<operation>: <ref-short> [detail]"' caused a YAML parse error. Had to rewrite as prose.
          Could use better guidance or validation for AC text with special characters.


          2. **No bulk trait assignment** - Had to run 'kspec item trait add' 6 times for 6
          commands. A batch option like '--refs @cmd1 @cmd2 @cmd3' would be helpful (similar to
          existing batch operations).


          3. **Plan mode file not visible** - The plan file at /home/chapel/.claude/plans/... isn't
          integrated with kspec. Would be nice to have 'kspec plan save' or similar to capture plan
          as a note on the task.


          4. **Task-spec gap warning at completion** - When completing @01KFKMF9, got 'This task has
          no spec_ref. Is this a spec gap?' but the task was about implementing a trait - the
          spec_ref should probably be @trait-shadow-commit but the task predated the trait creation.


          5. **Long meta.yaml file** - At ~2000 lines, finding specific command specs required
          multiple reads. No issue per se, but the file is getting unwieldy.

          Coverage check results:


          1. **Batch trait assignment** - NOT directly covered. @multi-ref-batch exists but only for
          task/item/inbox operations, not 'item trait add'. Could be extended or trait commands
          could adopt the trait.


          2. **YAML quoting/validation** - NOT tracked. No existing coverage for better AC text
          validation or quoting guidance.


          3. **Plan mode integration** - PARTIALLY covered. Found observation @01KFC3BM about plan
          mode cycles. But specific integration with kspec (saving plans to task notes) not tracked.


          4. **Task-spec gap at completion** - NOT tracked. The warning is helpful but could be
          smarter about newly-created specs.


          5. **Large meta.yaml** - NOT tracked. Could consider splitting into sub-modules
          (meta/commands.yaml, meta/observations.yaml, etc.) but not currently tracked.

          Proposed improvements for untracked friction:


          1. **Extend @multi-ref-batch to trait commands** (small)
             - Add --refs support to 'kspec item trait add' and 'kspec item trait remove'
             - Follows existing pattern from task/item commands
             - Would have saved 5 extra CLI calls this session

          2. **AC text validation/escaping guidance** (small)
             - When AC 'then' field contains special YAML chars (< > : "), warn or auto-escape
             - Or: document best practices in AGENTS.md for writing AC text
             - Prevents YAML parse errors during spec authoring

          3. **Smarter spec-gap detection at task completion** (medium)
             - If task was created before a spec that now exists with matching keywords, suggest linking
             - Or: check if task notes mention a spec ref that could be linked
             - Reduces false positives in 'Is this a spec gap?' warning

          User decisions:

          1. Batch trait assignment - User noted @trait-multi-ref-batch is already a trait, so the
          improvement is having trait commands adopt it. Will capture.

          2. AC text validation - Yes, capture to inbox

          3. Spec-gap detection - Skip. User says explicit linking is the point of the warning - if
          not linked, that's intentional friction to prompt action.
