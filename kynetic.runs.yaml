          What worked well:
          1. Subagent exploration gave comprehensive overview quickly
          2. Systematic testing of each feature area (session context, observations, workflow runs)
          3. workflow next auto-inferring active run - reduced command verbosity
          4. Multiline step content works in YAML - enables rich guidance

          Friction points identified:
          1. No --steps flag on 'meta add workflow' - had to manually edit YAML
          2. 'workflow show' requires run-ref even when only one active run (unlike next)
          3. --input flags silently ignored when step has no defined inputs - could confuse users
          4. cwd issue after 'cd .kspec && git commit' - easy to forget to cd back

          Proposed improvements:

          1. Add --steps flag to 'meta add workflow' (scope: small) - Allow defining steps at
          creation time using JSON array

          2. Make 'workflow show' infer active run like 'workflow next' (scope: small) -
          Consistency, less typing

          3. Warn when --input passed but step has no inputs defined (scope: small) - Prevent
          confusion

          Designed 8 steps for pr-review-merge workflow:


          1. [action] Create PR with implementation - kspec /pr or gh pr create

          2. [check] All CI checks pass - on_fail: Wait for CI, fix failures

          3. [action] Read review comments - Check automated review output

          4. [check] All review issues addressed - on_fail: Fix issues, push, re-run CI

          5. [action] Check for user @claude comments - Look for requests the PR agent couldn't
          complete

          6. [check] All pending actions completed - on_fail: Complete actions yourself before
          merging

          7. [check] All review threads resolved - on_fail: Click Resolve conversation on each
          thread

          8. [action] Merge PR - gh pr merge or GitHub UI


          This follows the Gate Pattern with multiple checks between actions.

          Designed 6 steps for local-review workflow:


          1. [action] Get spec reference and read ACs - input: spec_ref

          2. [check] Every AC has test coverage with // AC: annotation - on_fail: MUST-FIX, list
          missing ACs

          3. [check] All tests validate real behavior (no fluff tests) - on_fail: MUST-FIX, reject
          tests that always pass

          4. [check] Test strategy prefers E2E over unit tests - on_fail: Consider adding E2E tests
          for CLI functionality

          5. [check] Tests run in temp directories (not kspec repo) - on_fail: MUST-FIX, prevents
          nested worktree issues

          6. [action] Report findings - list all MUST-FIX issues


          Uses Gate pattern with strict checks. Input captures spec for traceability.
