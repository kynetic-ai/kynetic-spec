          What worked well:
          1. Subagent exploration gave comprehensive overview quickly
          2. Systematic testing of each feature area (session context, observations, workflow runs)
          3. workflow next auto-inferring active run - reduced command verbosity
          4. Multiline step content works in YAML - enables rich guidance

          Friction points identified:
          1. No --steps flag on 'meta add workflow' - had to manually edit YAML
          2. 'workflow show' requires run-ref even when only one active run (unlike next)
          3. --input flags silently ignored when step has no defined inputs - could confuse users
          4. cwd issue after 'cd .kspec && git commit' - easy to forget to cd back

          Proposed improvements:

          1. Add --steps flag to 'meta add workflow' (scope: small) - Allow defining steps at
          creation time using JSON array

          2. Make 'workflow show' infer active run like 'workflow next' (scope: small) -
          Consistency, less typing

          3. Warn when --input passed but step has no inputs defined (scope: small) - Prevent
          confusion

          Designed 8 steps for pr-review-merge workflow:


          1. [action] Create PR with implementation - kspec /pr or gh pr create

          2. [check] All CI checks pass - on_fail: Wait for CI, fix failures

          3. [action] Read review comments - Check automated review output

          4. [check] All review issues addressed - on_fail: Fix issues, push, re-run CI

          5. [action] Check for user @claude comments - Look for requests the PR agent couldn't
          complete

          6. [check] All pending actions completed - on_fail: Complete actions yourself before
          merging

          7. [check] All review threads resolved - on_fail: Click Resolve conversation on each
          thread

          8. [action] Merge PR - gh pr merge or GitHub UI


          This follows the Gate Pattern with multiple checks between actions.

          Designed 6 steps for local-review workflow:


          1. [action] Get spec reference and read ACs - input: spec_ref

          2. [check] Every AC has test coverage with // AC: annotation - on_fail: MUST-FIX, list
          missing ACs

          3. [check] All tests validate real behavior (no fluff tests) - on_fail: MUST-FIX, reject
          tests that always pass

          4. [check] Test strategy prefers E2E over unit tests - on_fail: Consider adding E2E tests
          for CLI functionality

          5. [check] Tests run in temp directories (not kspec repo) - on_fail: MUST-FIX, prevents
          nested worktree issues

          6. [action] Report findings - list all MUST-FIX issues


          Uses Gate pattern with strict checks. Input captures spec for traceability.

          What worked well this session:


          1. **Trait-based approach for cross-cutting behavior** - User's insight that traits aren't
          just for user-facing behavior but for any cross-cutting concern was key. Creating
          @trait-shadow-commit with explicit AC now makes the implicit shadow commit behavior
          testable and documented.


          2. **Subagent exploration before planning** - Using Explore agents to map ALL shadow write
          locations and a Plan agent to review for gaps caught 6 additional missing commits beyond
          the initial 4 identified. This thorough exploration prevented incomplete fixes.


          3. **Spec-first implementation** - Created the trait spec, added to command specs, THEN
          fixed the code. This ensures the spec is the source of truth and AC annotations in code
          reference back to spec.


          4. **kspec CLI for spec changes** - Using 'kspec item trait add' to add traits was much
          cleaner than manually editing YAML.


          5. **Clear design decision documentation** - Explicitly documenting that session context
          is NOT committed (transient state) prevents future confusion about why those commands
          don't have the trait.

          Friction points this session:


          1. **YAML quoting issues** - When adding the trait, the AC text 'message follows format
          "<operation>: <ref-short> [detail]"' caused a YAML parse error. Had to rewrite as prose.
          Could use better guidance or validation for AC text with special characters.


          2. **No bulk trait assignment** - Had to run 'kspec item trait add' 6 times for 6
          commands. A batch option like '--refs @cmd1 @cmd2 @cmd3' would be helpful (similar to
          existing batch operations).


          3. **Plan mode file not visible** - The plan file at /home/chapel/.claude/plans/... isn't
          integrated with kspec. Would be nice to have 'kspec plan save' or similar to capture plan
          as a note on the task.


          4. **Task-spec gap warning at completion** - When completing @01KFKMF9, got 'This task has
          no spec_ref. Is this a spec gap?' but the task was about implementing a trait - the
          spec_ref should probably be @trait-shadow-commit but the task predated the trait creation.


          5. **Long meta.yaml file** - At ~2000 lines, finding specific command specs required
          multiple reads. No issue per se, but the file is getting unwieldy.

          Coverage check results:


          1. **Batch trait assignment** - NOT directly covered. @multi-ref-batch exists but only for
          task/item/inbox operations, not 'item trait add'. Could be extended or trait commands
          could adopt the trait.


          2. **YAML quoting/validation** - NOT tracked. No existing coverage for better AC text
          validation or quoting guidance.


          3. **Plan mode integration** - PARTIALLY covered. Found observation @01KFC3BM about plan
          mode cycles. But specific integration with kspec (saving plans to task notes) not tracked.


          4. **Task-spec gap at completion** - NOT tracked. The warning is helpful but could be
          smarter about newly-created specs.


          5. **Large meta.yaml** - NOT tracked. Could consider splitting into sub-modules
          (meta/commands.yaml, meta/observations.yaml, etc.) but not currently tracked.

          Proposed improvements for untracked friction:


          1. **Extend @multi-ref-batch to trait commands** (small)
             - Add --refs support to 'kspec item trait add' and 'kspec item trait remove'
             - Follows existing pattern from task/item commands
             - Would have saved 5 extra CLI calls this session

          2. **AC text validation/escaping guidance** (small)
             - When AC 'then' field contains special YAML chars (< > : "), warn or auto-escape
             - Or: document best practices in AGENTS.md for writing AC text
             - Prevents YAML parse errors during spec authoring

          3. **Smarter spec-gap detection at task completion** (medium)
             - If task was created before a spec that now exists with matching keywords, suggest linking
             - Or: check if task notes mention a spec ref that could be linked
             - Reduces false positives in 'Is this a spec gap?' warning

          User decisions:

          1. Batch trait assignment - User noted @trait-multi-ref-batch is already a trait, so the
          improvement is having trait commands adopt it. Will capture.

          2. AC text validation - Yes, capture to inbox

          3. Spec-gap detection - Skip. User says explicit linking is the point of the warning - if
          not linked, that's intentional friction to prompt action.

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Parallel subagent research** - Launching two explore agents simultaneously (Svelte
          5/Playwright best practices + kynetic-internal E2E patterns) provided comprehensive
          context quickly without serial delays.


          2. **Spec-driven test design** - Reading the @web-dashboard spec (33 ACs) and mapping
          tests directly to acceptance criteria ensured complete coverage. The AC table format made
          gaps obvious.


          3. **Plan review subagent** - Having a Plan agent review the draft plan caught several
          critical issues: port allocation conflicts, WebSocket mocking API errors, missing filter
          coverage (assignee/automation). Iterative refinement improved quality.


          4. **Clarifying questions before execution** - Using AskUserQuestion for real daemon vs
          mocked, test organization approach, and mobile viewport testing prevented rework and
          aligned expectations early.


          5. **Leveraging existing patterns** - Referencing kynetic-internal's fixture factory
          pattern and WebSocket mocking approach provided proven templates rather than inventing
          from scratch.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **No --depends-on for task add** - Had to create tasks without dependencies, then would
          need manual YAML edits or separate commands to set up dependency chains. The 10 E2E tasks
          all depend on infrastructure setup but this relationship isn't captured in the system.


          2. **Plan file won't persist** - User had to clarify that tasks need standalone
          implementation details because the plan file at ~/.claude/plans/ won't be available to
          future sessions. This caused rework embedding all context into task notes.


          3. **Multiple kspec task note calls** - Creating 10 tasks each with detailed notes
          required 10+ sequential note commands. No bulk/batch operation for adding tasks with notes
          in one command.


          4. **No task grouping/parent-child** - The E2E tasks form a logical group under the parent
          @01KFMN01 epic, but there's no formal parent-child relationship in kspec. Had to note
          'Depends on @01KFP834' in prose rather than structured data.


          5. **AC coverage verification manual** - After creating all tasks, verifying 33/33
          @web-dashboard ACs are covered required manual cross-referencing. No automated 'kspec
          coverage' report.


          6. **Workflow syntax discovery** - Had to try --tags vs --tag, discover --depends-on
          doesn't exist. CLI help is available but workflow involved trial/error.

          ## Coverage Check Results

          ### 1. No --depends-on for task add
          **Status: Partially covered**
          - @spec-task-set-batch implements batch support for task set
          - @multi-ref-batch trait exists for batch operations
          - Inbox item 01KFC3SV proposes 'Batch command execution via JSON'
          - Inbox item proposes 'Spec-level depends_on field with derive integration'
          - **Gap**: No --depends-on flag on 'task add' specifically

          ### 2. Plan file won't persist (session context loss)
          **Status: Not directly tracked**
          - No existing item about plan file persistence
          - Related to session management but not captured

          ### 3. Multiple sequential note commands (no bulk task+notes)
          **Status: Partially covered**
          - @spec-task-set-batch and @trait-multi-ref-batch exist
          - Inbox 01KFC3SV: 'Batch command execution via JSON' proposes generic batch
          - **Gap**: No specific 'task add with notes' combination command

          ### 4. No formal parent-child task relationships
          **Status: Partially covered**
          - @task-type-epic exists for parent tasks
          - Inbox mentions 'Umbrella/parent tasks should depend on children'
          - **Gap**: No formal parent_task field or child enumeration

          ### 5. AC coverage verification manual
          **Status: Partially covered**
          - Inbox mentions 'AC coverage analysis tooling'
          - @trait-validation exists for trait AC coverage
          - **Gap**: No 'kspec coverage @spec' command for test coverage report

          ### 6. CLI syntax discovery/trial-error
          **Status: Not tracked**
          - CLI help exists but required iteration
          - No IDE completion or enhanced --help
      - step_index: 3

          ## Proposed Improvements for Untracked Friction


          ### 1. --depends-on flag for task add (Small)

          **What**: Add --depends-on flag to 'kspec task add' to set dependencies at creation time

          **How helps**: Eliminates need for follow-up command or manual YAML edit when creating
          dependent tasks

          **Scope**: Small - single flag addition to existing command


          ### 2. Session plan context persistence (Medium)

          **What**: Option to attach plan content to task notes automatically when creating tasks
          from plan mode

          **How helps**: Ensures implementation context survives session boundaries without manual
          embedding

          **Scope**: Medium - requires Claude Code skill/workflow integration


          ### 3. Compound task creation command (Medium)

          **What**: 'kspec task add-batch' or 'kspec task add --from-file tasks.yaml' for creating
          multiple related tasks with notes

          **How helps**: Creating 10 E2E tasks took 20+ commands; batch would be ~2 commands

          **Scope**: Medium - new command or file-based input mode

          **Note**: Partially addressed by inbox item 01KFC3SV (batch JSON)


          ### 4. Test coverage report command (Medium)

          **What**: 'kspec coverage @spec-ref' that scans codebase for '// AC: @spec ac-N'
          annotations and reports gaps

          **How helps**: Automated verification that all ACs have test coverage

          **Scope**: Medium - new command with code search

          **Note**: Related to inbox item about AC coverage analysis tooling

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Investigation-first approach** - Reading the task, exploring the code, understanding
          the root cause before proposing solutions. Found that tests were failing due to a separate
          bug (setupTempFixtures misuse) not the path resolution itself.


          2. **Documenting findings in task notes** - Added detailed investigation notes to
          @01KFP5Y1 before implementing. This created a clear audit trail of the decision to bundle
          daemon.


          3. **Incremental review feedback handling** - Addressed each Greptile comment as it came
          in, committed separately, which made the PR history clear and reviewable.


          4. **Cross-platform awareness surfaced via review** - The automated review caught
          Unix-specific commands (which, cp -r) that would have failed on Windows. Good example of
          review bots adding value.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **Daemon TypeScript compilation issues** - The daemon code has TypeScript errors when
          compiled with strict tsc (implicit any, Elysia type issues). Had to work around by copying
          source files instead of compiling. This is tech debt that will bite later.


          2. **Test expectations checking source code paths** - Static analysis tests were checking
          for specific import paths in daemon source. When I changed the imports, tests failed.
          These tests are brittle - checking implementation details rather than behavior.


          3. **Multiple workflow runs accumulating** - When running `kspec workflow next` there were
          19 active workflow runs to choose from. Clutters the system and slows down workflow
          commands.


          4. **No visibility into daemon startup failures** - When daemon failed to start within 5s
          timeout, no error details surfaced. Had to manually trace through to find the PID
          directory didn't exist.


          5. **Review feedback arrived incrementally** - Had to make 3 separate commits to address
          Greptile feedback that came in waves. Would be nice if review completed before starting
          fixes.

          ## Coverage Check


          1. **Daemon TypeScript compilation** - NOT TRACKED. The daemon uses Bun-specific patterns
          and has implicit any issues. No task/spec for fixing this.


          2. **Static analysis tests** - TRACKED in inbox @01KFND00: 'Convert daemon static analysis
          tests to real E2E tests'. This captures the brittleness issue.


          3. **Stale workflow runs** - NOT TRACKED. No spec/task for workflow run cleanup or
          auto-expiration.


          4. **Daemon startup error visibility** - PARTIALLY TRACKED. @01KFP5XQ covers the race
          condition but not the lack of error details when startup fails.


          5. **Incremental review feedback** - NOT TRACKED. This is more of a process observation
          than a kspec feature gap.

          ## Proposed Improvements


          1. **Fix daemon TypeScript strict mode compatibility** (medium)
             - What: Fix implicit any types, Elysia type issues in daemon code
             - How it helps: Enables proper compilation, catches type errors at build time
             - Scope: Medium - need to add types to route handlers, fix Elysia generics

          2. **Workflow run auto-cleanup or expiration** (small)
             - What: Auto-cancel workflow runs older than N days, or add 'workflow prune' command
             - How it helps: Prevents accumulation of stale runs that clutter workflow commands
             - Scope: Small - add prune command or TTL check

          3. **Daemon startup error capture** (small)
             - What: Capture daemon stderr during startup, show in error message if startup fails
             - How it helps: When daemon fails to start, user sees why instead of just 'failed within 5 seconds'
             - Scope: Small - pipe stderr to buffer, include in error output

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Task notes provided clear implementation guidance** - The task 01KFPRX9 had detailed
          step-by-step implementation notes covering exactly what files to create, configurations to
          use, and verification checklist. This made implementation straightforward.


          2. **Fixture isolation pattern** - Using temp directories with copied fixtures and daemon
          per-test worked well for test isolation. The daemon fixture pattern is clean and reusable.


          3. **Incremental testing approach** - Running tests after each significant change (ULID
          fixes, SSR fix, vitest exclusion) caught issues early before they compounded.


          4. **Cross-platform consideration caught in review** - The Greptile review flagged the
          lsof Windows issue, which was easy to fix proactively.


          5. **data-testid convention** - Adding testids to components was non-invasive and provides
          reliable selectors for E2E tests.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **ULID format debugging** - Manually crafting test ULIDs was error-prone (wrong length,
          invalid characters). Had to iterate multiple times to get valid 26-character Crockford
          base32 ULIDs. The testUlid() helper exists but isn't easily accessible outside test files.


          2. **Shared test fixtures interference** - Adding inbox items to tests/fixtures/ broke
          existing unit tests that expected to be first in the list. Had to understand test
          isolation assumptions before modifying shared fixtures.


          3. **E2E tests picked up by vitest** - Playwright tests use incompatible test.describe()
          API. Had to add explicit vitest exclusion. This wasn't documented anywhere as a
          requirement.


          4. **Working directory confusion** - Initially ran commands from packages/web-ui/ which
          caused issues with kspec commands. Had to remember to cd back to project root.


          5. **SSR compatibility not obvious** - The connection store throwing during SSR wasn't
          apparent until E2E tests ran against the built app. No linting or type checking caught it.

          ## Coverage Check


          1. **ULID format debugging** - Partially covered. @ulid-format spec exists for validation,
          and testUlid() helper exists in tests/helpers/cli.ts. But no documentation on using
          helpers for fixture creation. **Untracked gap: fixture ULID generation guidance**


          2. **Shared test fixtures interference** - Not tracked. No guidance on test fixture
          isolation patterns or when to add vs not add to shared fixtures.


          3. **E2E tests picked up by vitest** - Not tracked. Now fixed in vitest.config.ts but not
          documented. Future E2E additions would hit same issue.


          4. **Working directory confusion** - Partially covered. AGENTS.md mentions running from
          project root, but easy to forget mid-session.


          5. **SSR compatibility** - Not tracked. Web UI SSR issues aren't covered by existing
          specs. The fix was ad-hoc.

          ## Proposed Improvements

          1. **Document E2E test exclusion requirement** (Small)
             - Add note to test fixture patterns in AGENTS.md about vitest.config.ts exclusion
             - Prevents future E2E tests from breaking CI
             - Could also add a check in PR workflow

          2. **Add fixture ULID generation examples** (Small)
             - Document testUlid() usage in test fixture patterns section
             - Show examples for common prefixes
             - Saves debugging time when creating test fixtures

          3. **SSR compatibility checklist for web-ui** (Medium)
             - Document patterns that work in SSR (no-op when manager not initialized)
             - Add to web-ui development guide
             - Consider adding ESLint rule or build check

          Note: Working directory issue is already documented in AGENTS.md - just needs awareness.

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Task tracking kept context** - Using kspec task start/note kept the work organized
          and provided clear documentation when wrapping up


          2. **Systematic debugging approach** - Following the error trail (CORS -> initContext path
          -> static assets) helped identify the actual root cause vs symptoms


          3. **Incremental testing** - Running single test with --grep after each fix quickly showed
          what changed


          4. **Architecture simplification** - Recognizing that daemon should serve both UI and API
          (single origin) simplified the design vs maintaining separate servers


          5. **Error context from Playwright** - The error-context.md files with page snapshots were
          invaluable for understanding what the browser actually saw

          ## Friction Points


          1. **Stale daemon from previous sessions** - Had to manually kill daemon on port 3456 that
          was running from a previous test run. No automatic cleanup or detection.


          2. **Environment variable propagation unclear** - Setting WEB_UI_DIR in spawn env, but
          uncertain if it propagates through kspec -> daemon spawn chain. No easy way to verify.


          3. **build:daemon manual step** - After editing packages/daemon/src/*.ts, had to remember
          to run npm run build:daemon to copy to dist/. Easy to forget.


          4. **Many stale workflow runs** - Multiple active workflow runs accumulated (18 shown). No
          cleanup/timeout mechanism.


          5. **Static asset hash mismatch debugging** - No visibility into what path staticPlugin is
          using or what index.html it serves. Had to infer from error messages.


          6. **initContext path expectation mismatch** - initContext expects project root but daemon
          passes .kspec/ path. This architectural mismatch wasn't obvious until runtime error.


          7. **CORS port hardcoding** - CORS was hardcoded to specific ports (5173, 4173) instead of
          dynamic localhost matching. Had to trace through code to find.


          8. **No daemon logs in test** - Daemon spawns with stdio: ignore so errors are silent.
          Hard to debug what daemon is actually doing.

          ## Proposed Improvements (Untracked Friction)


          1. **Daemon auto-cleanup in E2E tests** (Small)
             - What: Test fixture should kill any daemon on target port before starting
             - Currently using lsof which isn't available on all systems
             - Better: Use fuser -k or cross-platform node-based port check
             - Helps: Prevents stale daemon failures, improves test reliability

          2. **Daemon watch mode for development** (Medium)
             - What: npm run dev:daemon that watches packages/daemon/src and auto-copies to dist/daemon
             - Or: Change daemon to run directly from packages/daemon/src instead of dist copy
             - Helps: Eliminates forgotten build:daemon step

          3. **Daemon startup logging option** (Small)
             - What: --log-file option for 'kspec serve start' that captures stdout/stderr
             - Or: --verbose flag that logs to console in foreground mode
             - Helps: Debug daemon issues without guessing

          4. **Static asset path logging** (Small)
             - What: Log which web UI path daemon resolved to on startup
             - Currently only logs 'Web UI assets found at: ...' in some cases
             - Helps: Debug asset serving issues like today's hash mismatch

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Subagent research pattern** - Delegated architecture research to a subagent which
          produced comprehensive findings with code examples, references, and concrete
          recommendations. This was more efficient than doing the research inline.


          2. **Systematic debugging** - When E2E tests failed with blank page, methodically traced:
          screenshot → asset hashes → HTML diff → discovered BUN_ENV issue. Each step narrowed the
          problem.


          3. **Session start habit** - Running 'kspec session start' immediately surfaced the
          in_progress task from previous session, preventing duplicate work.


          4. **Capturing scope expansion** - When debugging revealed architectural issues beyond the
          E2E task scope, immediately captured as inbox item, then promoted to proper task with full
          context from research.


          5. **BUN_ENV=production discovery** - Identified that Bun's dev mode was transforming HTML
          at runtime, causing asset hash mismatches. This was a non-obvious root cause.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **E2E test fixture environment propagation** - The test fixture sets WEB_UI_DIR env var
          when calling 'kspec serve start', but serve.ts spawns daemon without explicitly passing
          env. Had to trace through multiple spawn layers to understand why env wasn't reaching
          daemon.


          2. **No daemon logging visible** - When daemon fails or has errors, there's no way to see
          logs. Running in daemon mode with stdio:'ignore' means errors are lost. Had to manually
          run bun daemon.ts to see errors.


          3. **BUN_ENV not documented** - Discovered that BUN_ENV=production is required to prevent
          Bun from doing runtime HTML transformation. This is not documented anywhere and took
          significant debugging to discover.


          4. **Asset resolution relies on cwd** - Current resolveWebUiPath() uses process.cwd()
          which doesn't work when daemon is installed via npm in a different location than where
          it's run.


          5. **kspec --kspec-dir inconsistency** - serve command accepts --kspec-dir, but other
          commands (task, tasks) don't have this option. Makes it hard to test with isolated
          fixtures.


          6. **Test fixture doesn't verify daemon started correctly** - Fixture waits 1.5s then
          assumes success, but doesn't verify the daemon actually loaded kspec context correctly.
          API errors like '{} is not iterable' only discovered later in tests.


          7. **Shell cwd keeps resetting** - When running commands from /tmp directories, shell kept
          resetting to project root, making it hard to debug from test fixture locations.

          ## Proposed Improvements


          ### 1. BUN_ENV=production automation (Small)

          **What:** Automatically set BUN_ENV=production when spawning daemon in serve.ts

          **How it helps:** Prevents Bun's dev mode HTML transformation that causes asset hash
          mismatches

          **Scope:** Small - single line change in spawn() call in serve.ts


          ### 2. E2E test fixture health check (Medium)

          **What:** After starting daemon in test fixture, verify it's healthy by:
            - Calling /api/health endpoint
            - Checking response includes expected fields
            - Failing fast with clear error if daemon didn't start correctly
          **How it helps:** Catches daemon startup failures immediately instead of cryptic test
          failures later

          **Scope:** Medium - modify test-base.ts fixture, add retry logic


          ### 3. CLI-wide --kspec-dir option (Medium)

          **What:** Add --kspec-dir (or KSPEC_DIR env var) to all CLI commands, not just serve

          **How it helps:** Enables testing with isolated fixtures, running kspec for different
          projects without cd

          **Scope:** Medium - need to thread option through all commands, update initContext calls


          ### 4. Document Bun production mode requirement (Small)

          **What:** Add note to AGENTS.md or README about BUN_ENV=production for daemon

          **How it helps:** Prevents others from hitting same debugging session

          **Scope:** Small - documentation only

          What worked well this session:


          1. **Iterative question-based design** - Asking one design question at a time with the
          AskUserQuestion tool kept the spec work focused and got clear decisions (X-Kspec-Dir
          header, global PID location, etc.)


          2. **Subagent review of plan** - Having a Plan subagent review the spec plan caught
          several gaps (missing error cases, path validation, concurrent registration race
          conditions) before implementation.


          3. **Test-first task organization** - Organizing tasks into phases with tests before
          implementations creates clear dependency chains and enables TDD workflow.


          4. **Self-contained task descriptions** - Including implementation notes with file paths
          and line numbers in task descriptions means tasks can be picked up without needing the
          original plan context.


          5. **Spec-first workflow for architecture** - Using plan mode for the multi-directory
          daemon architecture spec ensured thorough exploration before writing code.

          Friction points this session:


          1. **No bulk AC add command** - Had to write all 36 acceptance criteria inline in YAML.
          Would be faster with: kspec item ac add @ref --given '...' --when '...' --then '...'
          (repeat for each AC). Currently must edit YAML directly.


          2. **Task dependency setup is verbose** - After creating 21 tasks, had to run 'kspec task
          set' separately for each dependency relationship. No way to specify depends_on during task
          add, and no bulk dependency setup.


          3. **Automation eligibility assessment requires manual iteration** - Had to run 'kspec
          task set --automation eligible' for each of 29 tasks individually. Would benefit from bulk
          mode: kspec task set --refs @a @b @c --automation eligible


          4. **Plan file location not obvious** - The plan mode system reminder tells you the path
          but it's easy to miss. Had to scroll to find
          /home/chapel/.claude/plans/graceful-zooming-fern.md.


          5. **AC numbering with sub-ACs awkward** - Used ac-8b, ac-9b, ac-9c, ac-10b, ac-21b
          pattern for added ACs. Schema may not support this well or expect sequential numbering.

          Coverage check results:

          @spec-task-set-batch for --refs batching.


          3. **Bulk automation eligibility** - NOT friction: 'kspec task set --refs @a @b

          **Actual untracked friction:**

          Proposed improvements for untracked friction:


          1. **task add --depends-on support** (Small)
             - What: Add --depends-on flag to 'kspec task add' command
             - How it helps: Set dependencies at creation time instead of requiring follow-up 'task set'
             - Scope: Small - add option parsing and pass to task creation

          2. **--add-depends-on flag for appending** (Small)
             - What: Add --add-depends-on to 'task set' that appends to existing deps (vs --depends-on which replaces)
             - How it helps: Easier to add one dependency without needing to re-specify all existing ones
             - Scope: Small - new flag, array concat instead of replace

          Already well-covered (no proposal needed):

          - Bulk AC add: use 'kspec item ac add' 

          - Bulk automation: use 'kspec task set --refs ... --automation'

          What worked well this session:


          1. **testUlid() helper**: Used the existing test utility to generate valid Crockford
          base32 ULIDs. Initially wrote hardcoded ULIDs with invalid chars (L, I, O) which caused
          silent fixture failures. The user pointed me to the utility - it auto-replaces invalid
          chars.


          2. **Structured task workflow**: The /task-work skill kept the work organized - starting
          with kspec task start, adding notes during work, then submitting when code was done.


          3. **Spec-first development**: The spec had clear acceptance criteria (3 ACs) which
          directly guided what tests to write and what features to implement.


          4. **Parallel exploration**: Used Task tool with Explore subagent to understand the
          existing workflow schema and CLI commands before making changes - avoided breaking
          existing functionality.


          5. **Incremental testing**: Ran tests after each change to catch issues early. The invalid
          ULID issue was caught quickly through test failures.

          Friction points this session:


          1. **Invalid ULID silent failures**: Wrote test fixture ULIDs with invalid Crockford chars
          (L, I, O, U). Tests appeared to pass but fixtures weren't loading properly. No clear error
          message indicated the ULID format issue - had to debug manually. The testUlid() helper
          exists but wasn't obvious to use for fixture YAML.


          2. **Many stale active workflow runs**: When running 'kspec workflow next' without a ref,
          got error listing 19 active runs. These accumulated over time and create noise.


          3. **YAML fixture indentation debugging**: When adding workflows to kynetic.meta.yaml in
          tests, spent time debugging indentation issues. The helper function I eventually wrote
          (addWorkflow) with proper structure would be useful as a reusable test utility.

          Searched specs, tasks, and inbox for existing coverage:


          1. **Invalid ULID silent failures**: NOT TRACKED. The testUlid() helper exists but there's
          no documentation or warning about using it for test fixtures. The AGENTS.md does mention
          ULID format requirements and the helper, but it's easy to miss.


          2. **Many stale active workflow runs**: ALREADY TRACKED. Found inbox item @01KFPH39 'Add
          workflow run auto-cleanup'. Exact match for this friction.


          3. **YAML fixture indentation debugging**: NOT TRACKED (partially). Test helpers exist
          (setupTempFixtures) but no helper specifically for adding items to YAML fixtures mid-test.
          This is a one-off friction that may not warrant a separate improvement.

          Proposed improvements for untracked friction:


          1. **Document testUlid() prominently for test fixtures**
             - What: Add a section to AGENTS.md or a test writing guide about using testUlid() for any ULID in test fixtures
             - How it helps: Prevents silent failures from invalid Crockford chars (L, I, O, U)
             - Scope: Small (documentation update)

          2. **Validation error for invalid ULIDs should be clearer**
             - What: When kspec validate fails on ULID format, the error message could suggest checking for invalid Crockford chars
             - How it helps: Faster debugging when fixtures have invalid ULIDs
             - Scope: Small (error message enhancement)

          Note: The workflow run cleanup is already captured in inbox.

          After discussion with user:


          1. **testUlid() documentation** - Already covered by PR #210 which adds ULID generation
          guidance to AGENTS.md


          2. **ULID validation error clarity** - Already clear! Validation shows 'Invalid ULID
          format' which is sufficient. The friction was a one-off mistake (not recognizing L, I, O,
          U are invalid Crockford chars), not a systemic issue.


          No improvements needed - both proposed items are already addressed.
