          What worked well:
          1. Subagent exploration gave comprehensive overview quickly
          2. Systematic testing of each feature area (session context, observations, workflow runs)
          3. workflow next auto-inferring active run - reduced command verbosity
          4. Multiline step content works in YAML - enables rich guidance

          Friction points identified:
          1. No --steps flag on 'meta add workflow' - had to manually edit YAML
          2. 'workflow show' requires run-ref even when only one active run (unlike next)
          3. --input flags silently ignored when step has no defined inputs - could confuse users
          4. cwd issue after 'cd .kspec && git commit' - easy to forget to cd back

          Proposed improvements:

          1. Add --steps flag to 'meta add workflow' (scope: small) - Allow defining steps at
          creation time using JSON array

          2. Make 'workflow show' infer active run like 'workflow next' (scope: small) -
          Consistency, less typing

          3. Warn when --input passed but step has no inputs defined (scope: small) - Prevent
          confusion

          Designed 8 steps for pr-review-merge workflow:


          1. [action] Create PR with implementation - kspec /pr or gh pr create

          2. [check] All CI checks pass - on_fail: Wait for CI, fix failures

          3. [action] Read review comments - Check automated review output

          4. [check] All review issues addressed - on_fail: Fix issues, push, re-run CI

          5. [action] Check for user @claude comments - Look for requests the PR agent couldn't
          complete

          6. [check] All pending actions completed - on_fail: Complete actions yourself before
          merging

          7. [check] All review threads resolved - on_fail: Click Resolve conversation on each
          thread

          8. [action] Merge PR - gh pr merge or GitHub UI


          This follows the Gate Pattern with multiple checks between actions.

          Designed 6 steps for local-review workflow:


          1. [action] Get spec reference and read ACs - input: spec_ref

          2. [check] Every AC has test coverage with // AC: annotation - on_fail: MUST-FIX, list
          missing ACs

          3. [check] All tests validate real behavior (no fluff tests) - on_fail: MUST-FIX, reject
          tests that always pass

          4. [check] Test strategy prefers E2E over unit tests - on_fail: Consider adding E2E tests
          for CLI functionality

          5. [check] Tests run in temp directories (not kspec repo) - on_fail: MUST-FIX, prevents
          nested worktree issues

          6. [action] Report findings - list all MUST-FIX issues


          Uses Gate pattern with strict checks. Input captures spec for traceability.

          What worked well this session:


          1. **Trait-based approach for cross-cutting behavior** - User's insight that traits aren't
          just for user-facing behavior but for any cross-cutting concern was key. Creating
          @trait-shadow-commit with explicit AC now makes the implicit shadow commit behavior
          testable and documented.


          2. **Subagent exploration before planning** - Using Explore agents to map ALL shadow write
          locations and a Plan agent to review for gaps caught 6 additional missing commits beyond
          the initial 4 identified. This thorough exploration prevented incomplete fixes.


          3. **Spec-first implementation** - Created the trait spec, added to command specs, THEN
          fixed the code. This ensures the spec is the source of truth and AC annotations in code
          reference back to spec.


          4. **kspec CLI for spec changes** - Using 'kspec item trait add' to add traits was much
          cleaner than manually editing YAML.


          5. **Clear design decision documentation** - Explicitly documenting that session context
          is NOT committed (transient state) prevents future confusion about why those commands
          don't have the trait.

          Friction points this session:


          1. **YAML quoting issues** - When adding the trait, the AC text 'message follows format
          "<operation>: <ref-short> [detail]"' caused a YAML parse error. Had to rewrite as prose.
          Could use better guidance or validation for AC text with special characters.


          2. **No bulk trait assignment** - Had to run 'kspec item trait add' 6 times for 6
          commands. A batch option like '--refs @cmd1 @cmd2 @cmd3' would be helpful (similar to
          existing batch operations).


          3. **Plan mode file not visible** - The plan file at /home/chapel/.claude/plans/... isn't
          integrated with kspec. Would be nice to have 'kspec plan save' or similar to capture plan
          as a note on the task.


          4. **Task-spec gap warning at completion** - When completing @01KFKMF9, got 'This task has
          no spec_ref. Is this a spec gap?' but the task was about implementing a trait - the
          spec_ref should probably be @trait-shadow-commit but the task predated the trait creation.


          5. **Long meta.yaml file** - At ~2000 lines, finding specific command specs required
          multiple reads. No issue per se, but the file is getting unwieldy.

          Coverage check results:


          1. **Batch trait assignment** - NOT directly covered. @multi-ref-batch exists but only for
          task/item/inbox operations, not 'item trait add'. Could be extended or trait commands
          could adopt the trait.


          2. **YAML quoting/validation** - NOT tracked. No existing coverage for better AC text
          validation or quoting guidance.


          3. **Plan mode integration** - PARTIALLY covered. Found observation @01KFC3BM about plan
          mode cycles. But specific integration with kspec (saving plans to task notes) not tracked.


          4. **Task-spec gap at completion** - NOT tracked. The warning is helpful but could be
          smarter about newly-created specs.


          5. **Large meta.yaml** - NOT tracked. Could consider splitting into sub-modules
          (meta/commands.yaml, meta/observations.yaml, etc.) but not currently tracked.

          Proposed improvements for untracked friction:


          1. **Extend @multi-ref-batch to trait commands** (small)
             - Add --refs support to 'kspec item trait add' and 'kspec item trait remove'
             - Follows existing pattern from task/item commands
             - Would have saved 5 extra CLI calls this session

          2. **AC text validation/escaping guidance** (small)
             - When AC 'then' field contains special YAML chars (< > : "), warn or auto-escape
             - Or: document best practices in AGENTS.md for writing AC text
             - Prevents YAML parse errors during spec authoring

          3. **Smarter spec-gap detection at task completion** (medium)
             - If task was created before a spec that now exists with matching keywords, suggest linking
             - Or: check if task notes mention a spec ref that could be linked
             - Reduces false positives in 'Is this a spec gap?' warning

          User decisions:

          1. Batch trait assignment - User noted @trait-multi-ref-batch is already a trait, so the
          improvement is having trait commands adopt it. Will capture.

          2. AC text validation - Yes, capture to inbox

          3. Spec-gap detection - Skip. User says explicit linking is the point of the warning - if
          not linked, that's intentional friction to prompt action.

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Parallel subagent research** - Launching two explore agents simultaneously (Svelte
          5/Playwright best practices + kynetic-internal E2E patterns) provided comprehensive
          context quickly without serial delays.


          2. **Spec-driven test design** - Reading the @web-dashboard spec (33 ACs) and mapping
          tests directly to acceptance criteria ensured complete coverage. The AC table format made
          gaps obvious.


          3. **Plan review subagent** - Having a Plan agent review the draft plan caught several
          critical issues: port allocation conflicts, WebSocket mocking API errors, missing filter
          coverage (assignee/automation). Iterative refinement improved quality.


          4. **Clarifying questions before execution** - Using AskUserQuestion for real daemon vs
          mocked, test organization approach, and mobile viewport testing prevented rework and
          aligned expectations early.


          5. **Leveraging existing patterns** - Referencing kynetic-internal's fixture factory
          pattern and WebSocket mocking approach provided proven templates rather than inventing
          from scratch.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **No --depends-on for task add** - Had to create tasks without dependencies, then would
          need manual YAML edits or separate commands to set up dependency chains. The 10 E2E tasks
          all depend on infrastructure setup but this relationship isn't captured in the system.


          2. **Plan file won't persist** - User had to clarify that tasks need standalone
          implementation details because the plan file at ~/.claude/plans/ won't be available to
          future sessions. This caused rework embedding all context into task notes.


          3. **Multiple kspec task note calls** - Creating 10 tasks each with detailed notes
          required 10+ sequential note commands. No bulk/batch operation for adding tasks with notes
          in one command.


          4. **No task grouping/parent-child** - The E2E tasks form a logical group under the parent
          @01KFMN01 epic, but there's no formal parent-child relationship in kspec. Had to note
          'Depends on @01KFP834' in prose rather than structured data.


          5. **AC coverage verification manual** - After creating all tasks, verifying 33/33
          @web-dashboard ACs are covered required manual cross-referencing. No automated 'kspec
          coverage' report.


          6. **Workflow syntax discovery** - Had to try --tags vs --tag, discover --depends-on
          doesn't exist. CLI help is available but workflow involved trial/error.

          ## Coverage Check Results

          ### 1. No --depends-on for task add
          **Status: Partially covered**
          - @spec-task-set-batch implements batch support for task set
          - @multi-ref-batch trait exists for batch operations
          - Inbox item 01KFC3SV proposes 'Batch command execution via JSON'
          - Inbox item proposes 'Spec-level depends_on field with derive integration'
          - **Gap**: No --depends-on flag on 'task add' specifically

          ### 2. Plan file won't persist (session context loss)
          **Status: Not directly tracked**
          - No existing item about plan file persistence
          - Related to session management but not captured

          ### 3. Multiple sequential note commands (no bulk task+notes)
          **Status: Partially covered**
          - @spec-task-set-batch and @trait-multi-ref-batch exist
          - Inbox 01KFC3SV: 'Batch command execution via JSON' proposes generic batch
          - **Gap**: No specific 'task add with notes' combination command

          ### 4. No formal parent-child task relationships
          **Status: Partially covered**
          - @task-type-epic exists for parent tasks
          - Inbox mentions 'Umbrella/parent tasks should depend on children'
          - **Gap**: No formal parent_task field or child enumeration

          ### 5. AC coverage verification manual
          **Status: Partially covered**
          - Inbox mentions 'AC coverage analysis tooling'
          - @trait-validation exists for trait AC coverage
          - **Gap**: No 'kspec coverage @spec' command for test coverage report

          ### 6. CLI syntax discovery/trial-error
          **Status: Not tracked**
          - CLI help exists but required iteration
          - No IDE completion or enhanced --help
      - step_index: 3

          ## Proposed Improvements for Untracked Friction


          ### 1. --depends-on flag for task add (Small)

          **What**: Add --depends-on flag to 'kspec task add' to set dependencies at creation time

          **How helps**: Eliminates need for follow-up command or manual YAML edit when creating
          dependent tasks

          **Scope**: Small - single flag addition to existing command


          ### 2. Session plan context persistence (Medium)

          **What**: Option to attach plan content to task notes automatically when creating tasks
          from plan mode

          **How helps**: Ensures implementation context survives session boundaries without manual
          embedding

          **Scope**: Medium - requires Claude Code skill/workflow integration


          ### 3. Compound task creation command (Medium)

          **What**: 'kspec task add-batch' or 'kspec task add --from-file tasks.yaml' for creating
          multiple related tasks with notes

          **How helps**: Creating 10 E2E tasks took 20+ commands; batch would be ~2 commands

          **Scope**: Medium - new command or file-based input mode

          **Note**: Partially addressed by inbox item 01KFC3SV (batch JSON)


          ### 4. Test coverage report command (Medium)

          **What**: 'kspec coverage @spec-ref' that scans codebase for '// AC: @spec ac-N'
          annotations and reports gaps

          **How helps**: Automated verification that all ACs have test coverage

          **Scope**: Medium - new command with code search

          **Note**: Related to inbox item about AC coverage analysis tooling

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Investigation-first approach** - Reading the task, exploring the code, understanding
          the root cause before proposing solutions. Found that tests were failing due to a separate
          bug (setupTempFixtures misuse) not the path resolution itself.


          2. **Documenting findings in task notes** - Added detailed investigation notes to
          @01KFP5Y1 before implementing. This created a clear audit trail of the decision to bundle
          daemon.


          3. **Incremental review feedback handling** - Addressed each Greptile comment as it came
          in, committed separately, which made the PR history clear and reviewable.


          4. **Cross-platform awareness surfaced via review** - The automated review caught
          Unix-specific commands (which, cp -r) that would have failed on Windows. Good example of
          review bots adding value.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **Daemon TypeScript compilation issues** - The daemon code has TypeScript errors when
          compiled with strict tsc (implicit any, Elysia type issues). Had to work around by copying
          source files instead of compiling. This is tech debt that will bite later.


          2. **Test expectations checking source code paths** - Static analysis tests were checking
          for specific import paths in daemon source. When I changed the imports, tests failed.
          These tests are brittle - checking implementation details rather than behavior.


          3. **Multiple workflow runs accumulating** - When running `kspec workflow next` there were
          19 active workflow runs to choose from. Clutters the system and slows down workflow
          commands.


          4. **No visibility into daemon startup failures** - When daemon failed to start within 5s
          timeout, no error details surfaced. Had to manually trace through to find the PID
          directory didn't exist.


          5. **Review feedback arrived incrementally** - Had to make 3 separate commits to address
          Greptile feedback that came in waves. Would be nice if review completed before starting
          fixes.

          ## Coverage Check


          1. **Daemon TypeScript compilation** - NOT TRACKED. The daemon uses Bun-specific patterns
          and has implicit any issues. No task/spec for fixing this.


          2. **Static analysis tests** - TRACKED in inbox @01KFND00: 'Convert daemon static analysis
          tests to real E2E tests'. This captures the brittleness issue.


          3. **Stale workflow runs** - NOT TRACKED. No spec/task for workflow run cleanup or
          auto-expiration.


          4. **Daemon startup error visibility** - PARTIALLY TRACKED. @01KFP5XQ covers the race
          condition but not the lack of error details when startup fails.


          5. **Incremental review feedback** - NOT TRACKED. This is more of a process observation
          than a kspec feature gap.

          ## Proposed Improvements


          1. **Fix daemon TypeScript strict mode compatibility** (medium)
             - What: Fix implicit any types, Elysia type issues in daemon code
             - How it helps: Enables proper compilation, catches type errors at build time
             - Scope: Medium - need to add types to route handlers, fix Elysia generics

          2. **Workflow run auto-cleanup or expiration** (small)
             - What: Auto-cancel workflow runs older than N days, or add 'workflow prune' command
             - How it helps: Prevents accumulation of stale runs that clutter workflow commands
             - Scope: Small - add prune command or TTL check

          3. **Daemon startup error capture** (small)
             - What: Capture daemon stderr during startup, show in error message if startup fails
             - How it helps: When daemon fails to start, user sees why instead of just 'failed within 5 seconds'
             - Scope: Small - pipe stderr to buffer, include in error output

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Task notes provided clear implementation guidance** - The task 01KFPRX9 had detailed
          step-by-step implementation notes covering exactly what files to create, configurations to
          use, and verification checklist. This made implementation straightforward.


          2. **Fixture isolation pattern** - Using temp directories with copied fixtures and daemon
          per-test worked well for test isolation. The daemon fixture pattern is clean and reusable.


          3. **Incremental testing approach** - Running tests after each significant change (ULID
          fixes, SSR fix, vitest exclusion) caught issues early before they compounded.


          4. **Cross-platform consideration caught in review** - The Greptile review flagged the
          lsof Windows issue, which was easy to fix proactively.


          5. **data-testid convention** - Adding testids to components was non-invasive and provides
          reliable selectors for E2E tests.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **ULID format debugging** - Manually crafting test ULIDs was error-prone (wrong length,
          invalid characters). Had to iterate multiple times to get valid 26-character Crockford
          base32 ULIDs. The testUlid() helper exists but isn't easily accessible outside test files.


          2. **Shared test fixtures interference** - Adding inbox items to tests/fixtures/ broke
          existing unit tests that expected to be first in the list. Had to understand test
          isolation assumptions before modifying shared fixtures.


          3. **E2E tests picked up by vitest** - Playwright tests use incompatible test.describe()
          API. Had to add explicit vitest exclusion. This wasn't documented anywhere as a
          requirement.


          4. **Working directory confusion** - Initially ran commands from packages/web-ui/ which
          caused issues with kspec commands. Had to remember to cd back to project root.


          5. **SSR compatibility not obvious** - The connection store throwing during SSR wasn't
          apparent until E2E tests ran against the built app. No linting or type checking caught it.

          ## Coverage Check


          1. **ULID format debugging** - Partially covered. @ulid-format spec exists for validation,
          and testUlid() helper exists in tests/helpers/cli.ts. But no documentation on using
          helpers for fixture creation. **Untracked gap: fixture ULID generation guidance**


          2. **Shared test fixtures interference** - Not tracked. No guidance on test fixture
          isolation patterns or when to add vs not add to shared fixtures.


          3. **E2E tests picked up by vitest** - Not tracked. Now fixed in vitest.config.ts but not
          documented. Future E2E additions would hit same issue.


          4. **Working directory confusion** - Partially covered. AGENTS.md mentions running from
          project root, but easy to forget mid-session.


          5. **SSR compatibility** - Not tracked. Web UI SSR issues aren't covered by existing
          specs. The fix was ad-hoc.

          ## Proposed Improvements

          1. **Document E2E test exclusion requirement** (Small)
             - Add note to test fixture patterns in AGENTS.md about vitest.config.ts exclusion
             - Prevents future E2E tests from breaking CI
             - Could also add a check in PR workflow

          2. **Add fixture ULID generation examples** (Small)
             - Document testUlid() usage in test fixture patterns section
             - Show examples for common prefixes
             - Saves debugging time when creating test fixtures

          3. **SSR compatibility checklist for web-ui** (Medium)
             - Document patterns that work in SSR (no-op when manager not initialized)
             - Add to web-ui development guide
             - Consider adding ESLint rule or build check

          Note: Working directory issue is already documented in AGENTS.md - just needs awareness.

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Task tracking kept context** - Using kspec task start/note kept the work organized
          and provided clear documentation when wrapping up


          2. **Systematic debugging approach** - Following the error trail (CORS -> initContext path
          -> static assets) helped identify the actual root cause vs symptoms


          3. **Incremental testing** - Running single test with --grep after each fix quickly showed
          what changed


          4. **Architecture simplification** - Recognizing that daemon should serve both UI and API
          (single origin) simplified the design vs maintaining separate servers


          5. **Error context from Playwright** - The error-context.md files with page snapshots were
          invaluable for understanding what the browser actually saw

          ## Friction Points


          1. **Stale daemon from previous sessions** - Had to manually kill daemon on port 3456 that
          was running from a previous test run. No automatic cleanup or detection.


          2. **Environment variable propagation unclear** - Setting WEB_UI_DIR in spawn env, but
          uncertain if it propagates through kspec -> daemon spawn chain. No easy way to verify.


          3. **build:daemon manual step** - After editing packages/daemon/src/*.ts, had to remember
          to run npm run build:daemon to copy to dist/. Easy to forget.


          4. **Many stale workflow runs** - Multiple active workflow runs accumulated (18 shown). No
          cleanup/timeout mechanism.


          5. **Static asset hash mismatch debugging** - No visibility into what path staticPlugin is
          using or what index.html it serves. Had to infer from error messages.


          6. **initContext path expectation mismatch** - initContext expects project root but daemon
          passes .kspec/ path. This architectural mismatch wasn't obvious until runtime error.


          7. **CORS port hardcoding** - CORS was hardcoded to specific ports (5173, 4173) instead of
          dynamic localhost matching. Had to trace through code to find.


          8. **No daemon logs in test** - Daemon spawns with stdio: ignore so errors are silent.
          Hard to debug what daemon is actually doing.

          ## Proposed Improvements (Untracked Friction)


          1. **Daemon auto-cleanup in E2E tests** (Small)
             - What: Test fixture should kill any daemon on target port before starting
             - Currently using lsof which isn't available on all systems
             - Better: Use fuser -k or cross-platform node-based port check
             - Helps: Prevents stale daemon failures, improves test reliability

          2. **Daemon watch mode for development** (Medium)
             - What: npm run dev:daemon that watches packages/daemon/src and auto-copies to dist/daemon
             - Or: Change daemon to run directly from packages/daemon/src instead of dist copy
             - Helps: Eliminates forgotten build:daemon step

          3. **Daemon startup logging option** (Small)
             - What: --log-file option for 'kspec serve start' that captures stdout/stderr
             - Or: --verbose flag that logs to console in foreground mode
             - Helps: Debug daemon issues without guessing

          4. **Static asset path logging** (Small)
             - What: Log which web UI path daemon resolved to on startup
             - Currently only logs 'Web UI assets found at: ...' in some cases
             - Helps: Debug asset serving issues like today's hash mismatch

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Subagent research pattern** - Delegated architecture research to a subagent which
          produced comprehensive findings with code examples, references, and concrete
          recommendations. This was more efficient than doing the research inline.


          2. **Systematic debugging** - When E2E tests failed with blank page, methodically traced:
          screenshot → asset hashes → HTML diff → discovered BUN_ENV issue. Each step narrowed the
          problem.


          3. **Session start habit** - Running 'kspec session start' immediately surfaced the
          in_progress task from previous session, preventing duplicate work.


          4. **Capturing scope expansion** - When debugging revealed architectural issues beyond the
          E2E task scope, immediately captured as inbox item, then promoted to proper task with full
          context from research.


          5. **BUN_ENV=production discovery** - Identified that Bun's dev mode was transforming HTML
          at runtime, causing asset hash mismatches. This was a non-obvious root cause.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **E2E test fixture environment propagation** - The test fixture sets WEB_UI_DIR env var
          when calling 'kspec serve start', but serve.ts spawns daemon without explicitly passing
          env. Had to trace through multiple spawn layers to understand why env wasn't reaching
          daemon.


          2. **No daemon logging visible** - When daemon fails or has errors, there's no way to see
          logs. Running in daemon mode with stdio:'ignore' means errors are lost. Had to manually
          run bun daemon.ts to see errors.


          3. **BUN_ENV not documented** - Discovered that BUN_ENV=production is required to prevent
          Bun from doing runtime HTML transformation. This is not documented anywhere and took
          significant debugging to discover.


          4. **Asset resolution relies on cwd** - Current resolveWebUiPath() uses process.cwd()
          which doesn't work when daemon is installed via npm in a different location than where
          it's run.


          5. **kspec --kspec-dir inconsistency** - serve command accepts --kspec-dir, but other
          commands (task, tasks) don't have this option. Makes it hard to test with isolated
          fixtures.


          6. **Test fixture doesn't verify daemon started correctly** - Fixture waits 1.5s then
          assumes success, but doesn't verify the daemon actually loaded kspec context correctly.
          API errors like '{} is not iterable' only discovered later in tests.


          7. **Shell cwd keeps resetting** - When running commands from /tmp directories, shell kept
          resetting to project root, making it hard to debug from test fixture locations.

          ## Proposed Improvements


          ### 1. BUN_ENV=production automation (Small)

          **What:** Automatically set BUN_ENV=production when spawning daemon in serve.ts

          **How it helps:** Prevents Bun's dev mode HTML transformation that causes asset hash
          mismatches

          **Scope:** Small - single line change in spawn() call in serve.ts


          ### 2. E2E test fixture health check (Medium)

          **What:** After starting daemon in test fixture, verify it's healthy by:
            - Calling /api/health endpoint
            - Checking response includes expected fields
            - Failing fast with clear error if daemon didn't start correctly
          **How it helps:** Catches daemon startup failures immediately instead of cryptic test
          failures later

          **Scope:** Medium - modify test-base.ts fixture, add retry logic


          ### 3. CLI-wide --kspec-dir option (Medium)

          **What:** Add --kspec-dir (or KSPEC_DIR env var) to all CLI commands, not just serve

          **How it helps:** Enables testing with isolated fixtures, running kspec for different
          projects without cd

          **Scope:** Medium - need to thread option through all commands, update initContext calls


          ### 4. Document Bun production mode requirement (Small)

          **What:** Add note to AGENTS.md or README about BUN_ENV=production for daemon

          **How it helps:** Prevents others from hitting same debugging session

          **Scope:** Small - documentation only

          What worked well this session:


          1. **Iterative question-based design** - Asking one design question at a time with the
          AskUserQuestion tool kept the spec work focused and got clear decisions (X-Kspec-Dir
          header, global PID location, etc.)


          2. **Subagent review of plan** - Having a Plan subagent review the spec plan caught
          several gaps (missing error cases, path validation, concurrent registration race
          conditions) before implementation.


          3. **Test-first task organization** - Organizing tasks into phases with tests before
          implementations creates clear dependency chains and enables TDD workflow.


          4. **Self-contained task descriptions** - Including implementation notes with file paths
          and line numbers in task descriptions means tasks can be picked up without needing the
          original plan context.


          5. **Spec-first workflow for architecture** - Using plan mode for the multi-directory
          daemon architecture spec ensured thorough exploration before writing code.

          Friction points this session:


          1. **No bulk AC add command** - Had to write all 36 acceptance criteria inline in YAML.
          Would be faster with: kspec item ac add @ref --given '...' --when '...' --then '...'
          (repeat for each AC). Currently must edit YAML directly.


          2. **Task dependency setup is verbose** - After creating 21 tasks, had to run 'kspec task
          set' separately for each dependency relationship. No way to specify depends_on during task
          add, and no bulk dependency setup.


          3. **Automation eligibility assessment requires manual iteration** - Had to run 'kspec
          task set --automation eligible' for each of 29 tasks individually. Would benefit from bulk
          mode: kspec task set --refs @a @b @c --automation eligible


          4. **Plan file location not obvious** - The plan mode system reminder tells you the path
          but it's easy to miss. Had to scroll to find
          /home/chapel/.claude/plans/graceful-zooming-fern.md.


          5. **AC numbering with sub-ACs awkward** - Used ac-8b, ac-9b, ac-9c, ac-10b, ac-21b
          pattern for added ACs. Schema may not support this well or expect sequential numbering.

          Coverage check results:

          @spec-task-set-batch for --refs batching.


          3. **Bulk automation eligibility** - NOT friction: 'kspec task set --refs @a @b

          **Actual untracked friction:**

          Proposed improvements for untracked friction:


          1. **task add --depends-on support** (Small)
             - What: Add --depends-on flag to 'kspec task add' command
             - How it helps: Set dependencies at creation time instead of requiring follow-up 'task set'
             - Scope: Small - add option parsing and pass to task creation

          2. **--add-depends-on flag for appending** (Small)
             - What: Add --add-depends-on to 'task set' that appends to existing deps (vs --depends-on which replaces)
             - How it helps: Easier to add one dependency without needing to re-specify all existing ones
             - Scope: Small - new flag, array concat instead of replace

          Already well-covered (no proposal needed):

          - Bulk AC add: use 'kspec item ac add' 

          - Bulk automation: use 'kspec task set --refs ... --automation'

          What worked well this session:


          1. **testUlid() helper**: Used the existing test utility to generate valid Crockford
          base32 ULIDs. Initially wrote hardcoded ULIDs with invalid chars (L, I, O) which caused
          silent fixture failures. The user pointed me to the utility - it auto-replaces invalid
          chars.


          2. **Structured task workflow**: The /task-work skill kept the work organized - starting
          with kspec task start, adding notes during work, then submitting when code was done.


          3. **Spec-first development**: The spec had clear acceptance criteria (3 ACs) which
          directly guided what tests to write and what features to implement.


          4. **Parallel exploration**: Used Task tool with Explore subagent to understand the
          existing workflow schema and CLI commands before making changes - avoided breaking
          existing functionality.


          5. **Incremental testing**: Ran tests after each change to catch issues early. The invalid
          ULID issue was caught quickly through test failures.

          Friction points this session:


          1. **Invalid ULID silent failures**: Wrote test fixture ULIDs with invalid Crockford chars
          (L, I, O, U). Tests appeared to pass but fixtures weren't loading properly. No clear error
          message indicated the ULID format issue - had to debug manually. The testUlid() helper
          exists but wasn't obvious to use for fixture YAML.


          2. **Many stale active workflow runs**: When running 'kspec workflow next' without a ref,
          got error listing 19 active runs. These accumulated over time and create noise.


          3. **YAML fixture indentation debugging**: When adding workflows to kynetic.meta.yaml in
          tests, spent time debugging indentation issues. The helper function I eventually wrote
          (addWorkflow) with proper structure would be useful as a reusable test utility.

          Searched specs, tasks, and inbox for existing coverage:


          1. **Invalid ULID silent failures**: NOT TRACKED. The testUlid() helper exists but there's
          no documentation or warning about using it for test fixtures. The AGENTS.md does mention
          ULID format requirements and the helper, but it's easy to miss.


          2. **Many stale active workflow runs**: ALREADY TRACKED. Found inbox item @01KFPH39 'Add
          workflow run auto-cleanup'. Exact match for this friction.


          3. **YAML fixture indentation debugging**: NOT TRACKED (partially). Test helpers exist
          (setupTempFixtures) but no helper specifically for adding items to YAML fixtures mid-test.
          This is a one-off friction that may not warrant a separate improvement.

          Proposed improvements for untracked friction:


          1. **Document testUlid() prominently for test fixtures**
             - What: Add a section to AGENTS.md or a test writing guide about using testUlid() for any ULID in test fixtures
             - How it helps: Prevents silent failures from invalid Crockford chars (L, I, O, U)
             - Scope: Small (documentation update)

          2. **Validation error for invalid ULIDs should be clearer**
             - What: When kspec validate fails on ULID format, the error message could suggest checking for invalid Crockford chars
             - How it helps: Faster debugging when fixtures have invalid ULIDs
             - Scope: Small (error message enhancement)

          Note: The workflow run cleanup is already captured in inbox.

          After discussion with user:


          1. **testUlid() documentation** - Already covered by PR #210 which adds ULID generation
          guidance to AGENTS.md


          2. **ULID validation error clarity** - Already clear! Validation shows 'Invalid ULID
          format' which is sufficient. The friction was a one-off mistake (not recognizing L, I, O,
          U are invalid Crockford chars), not a systemic issue.


          No improvements needed - both proposed items are already addressed.

          What worked well:

          1. Clear AC structure - The 7 ACs in @ralph-skill-delegation made implementation scope
          immediately clear

          2. Test-first approach - Added tests for ac-1, ac-2, ac-3 before implementation helped
          validate changes

          3. Dry-run mode - Using --dry-run in tests allowed validating prompt structure without
          running full agent

          4. AC annotations in code - Marking implementation with // AC: @spec ac-N creates clear
          traceability

          Friction points:

          1. Multiple active workflow runs - Got error about 34 active runs when trying to use
          workflow next without specifying ID. No easy way to list/complete/cancel stale runs.

          2. CI waiting pattern - After PR creation, had to manually wait for CI. No command to
          block until CI completes or get notified.

          3. buildPrompt signature change - Adding sessionId parameter required finding all call
          sites. TypeScript caught it, but no automated test failed initially.

          ## What Worked Well


          ### 1. Systematic Task Audit Pattern

          Using subagents to explore and analyze multiple tasks in parallel was highly effective.
          The pattern of:

          - Spawn agent to analyze → get structured findings → act on findings

          worked well for auditing both the E2E test tasks and the daemon test tasks.


          ### 2. Reframing Test Tasks as Implementation Tasks

          The insight that 'write tests' tasks should be 'implement feature, validated by tests' was
          valuable. The reframing pattern:

          - Old: 'E2E Tasks View Tests'

          - New: 'Implement Tasks View (AC-4 to AC-10, AC-33)'

          with clear implementation steps, required testIds, and 'no test.skip()' in Definition of
          Done.


          ### 3. AC Coverage Verification

          Going beyond 'tests exist' to verify 'tests actually cover the claimed ACs' caught issues
          that a simple test count would miss. Found documentary tests that pass even when
          implementation missing.


          ### 4. PR Review → Fix → Merge Flow

          The Greptile review → fix locator issues → verify tests pass → merge flow was efficient.
          Caught real bugs (count after first always returns 1).


          ### 5. Parallel Subagent Analysis

          Running two subagents in parallel (PR review + shadow branch review) to gather context was
          efficient.

          ## Friction Points


          ### 1. Documentary Test Anti-Pattern Not Prevented

          Agents wrote 'documentary' tests with test.skip() that passed CI but didn't verify
          anything. The task instructions allowed this interpretation. No guardrail prevented it.


          **Systemic issue**: Task framing as 'write tests' vs 'implement feature validated by
          tests' leads to this outcome.


          ### 2. Tasks Left Pending After PR Merge

          PRs #229, #232, #233 merged with skipped tests, but tasks stayed pending. The agent knew
          tests didn't work but didn't close or flag the tasks appropriately.


          **Systemic issue**: No enforcement that 'task complete' requires actually completing the
          work.


          ### 3. Wrong ULIDs in Task References

          When searching for tasks, got wrong ULIDs (e.g., @01KFQACV vs @01KFQACQ). Had to do
          multiple searches to find actual tasks.


          **Systemic issue**: Task reference resolution can be ambiguous with partial ULIDs.


          ### 4. Task Lifecycle Ceremony for Closing Complete Work

          To close tasks that were already done, had to: start → submit → complete. Three commands
          for work that was already verified complete.


          **Possible improvement**: Allow completing from pending if work is done (with
          verification).


          ### 5. No Bulk Task Operations

          Had to update 10+ tasks one at a time. Each note/title update was a separate command.


          **Systemic issue**: No bulk operations for task management.


          ### 6. Automation Eligibility Defaulting to Eligible

          Most tasks were 'automation: eligible' without assessment. This allowed ralph to pick them
          up and produce documentary tests.


          **Systemic issue**: Should default to 'unassessed' and require explicit eligibility
          assessment.

          ## Coverage Check


          ### Friction 1: Documentary Test Anti-Pattern

          - **Partially tracked**: The specific tasks (@01KFQADD, @01KFQAF9) were reframed today

          - **Not tracked**: No systemic prevention mechanism (task template, validation, etc.)


          ### Friction 2: Tasks Left Pending After PR Merge

          - **Not tracked**: No spec or task for enforcing task completion on PR merge


          ### Friction 3: Wrong ULIDs in Task References

          - **Not tracked**: Appears to be a search/resolution issue, not documented


          ### Friction 4: Task Lifecycle Ceremony

          - **Partially tracked**: @task-type-task and @task-commands exist but don't address
          shortcut for verified-complete work

          - **Inbox item**: @01KF8TQ5 mentions transaction/batch but not this specific issue


          ### Friction 5: No Bulk Task Operations

          - **Tracked**: @spec-task-set-batch (implemented), @multi-ref-batch (implemented)

          - **Inbox**: @01KFMP5R specifically about applying multi-ref-batch to task set
          --automation

          - **May already be implemented** - need to verify


          ### Friction 6: Automation Eligibility Defaults

          - **Tracked**: @task-automation-eligibility spec exists

          - **Partially addressed**: System exists but default behavior may need review

          ## Proposed Improvements (Untracked Friction)

          ### 1. E2E Test Task Template with Anti-Skip Guardrails
          **What**: Create a task template for UI implementation tasks that:
          - Frames as 'Implement X validated by tests' not 'Write tests for X'
          - Includes prerequisite checklist (verify testIds exist, add if missing)
          - Has Definition of Done with 'No test.skip()' explicitly stated
          - Provides example test structure

          **How it helps**: Prevents agents from producing documentary tests
          **Scope**: Small - documentation/template change

          ### 2. Task Completion Validation
          **What**: Add validation when marking task complete:
          - If task has test-related tags, verify tests actually pass
          - Warn if PR merged but task has no completion note
          - Consider: 'kspec task complete --verify' flag

          **How it helps**: Catches tasks being closed without actual completion
          **Scope**: Medium - CLI enhancement

          ### 3. Automation Eligibility Assessment Requirement
          **What**: Tasks should not default to 'eligible'. Options:
          - Default to 'unassessed' (current behavior is inconsistent)
          - Require assessment before ralph can pick up task
          - Add 'kspec task assess' command with guided questions

          **How it helps**: Prevents ralph from picking up complex tasks without review
          **Scope**: Medium - behavior change + possible new command

          ### 4. PR-Task Linkage Audit
          **What**: When a PR is merged with 'Task: @ref' trailer:
          - Check if task is still pending
          - Prompt to complete or flag discrepancy

          **How it helps**: Catches orphaned tasks after PR merge
          **Scope**: Medium - requires PR/CI integration

          Session review complete.

          SUCCESSES (high confidence):
          1. Scope expansion guidance worked - implemented file locking instead of test.skip()
          2. Workflow DoD verification step prevented anti-pattern delivery
          3. TodoWrite tracking kept implementation focused

          FRICTION (none systemic):
          - Unused import 'spawn' added but not used (one-off mistake)
          - Long import line (minor style issue, not systemic)

          EXISTING COVERAGE CHECK:
          - Scope expansion already tracked: @01KFQ8W7 (success observation)
          - DoD in workflows: Multiple tasks reference it, part of standard practice
          - TodoWrite effectiveness: Already well-established pattern

          NO NEW CAPTURES NEEDED - all patterns already tracked or non-systemic.

          EVALUATION:


          1. Scope expansion guidance effectiveness:
             - Status: SKIP - Already tracked in @01KFQ8W7
             - Reason: Duplicate of existing success observation

          2. Workflow DoD verification preventing anti-patterns:
             - Status: SKIP - Already part of workflow definition
             - Reason: Standard practice, well-established

          3. TodoWrite for task tracking:
             - Status: SKIP - Already established pattern
             - Reason: Standard practice, commonly used

          4. Unused import (spawn):
             - Status: SKIP - One-off mistake
             - Reason: Not systemic, low confidence

          5. Long import line:
             - Status: SKIP - Minor style issue
             - Reason: Not systemic, low confidence

          RESULT: No new items to capture. All successes already tracked or standard practice.
          Friction points were one-off issues.

          NO ITEMS TO CAPTURE

          All identified patterns were either:
          - Already tracked (scope expansion: @01KFQ8W7)
          - Standard established practices (DoD checks, TodoWrite)
          - One-off issues not worth capturing (unused import, style)

          Session was successful with good workflow adherence.
          Reflection complete with zero captures (appropriate outcome).

          Session Review Complete:


          What Worked Well:

          - Systematic dependency checking prevented wasted effort on blocked tasks

          - Verification-first approach: checked existing implementation before assuming work needed

          - Test coverage added alongside implementation maintained quality

          - Conventional commits with Task/Spec trailers maintained traceability


          Friction Points Identified:

          1. Web UI tasks marked automation-eligible despite requiring major architectural decisions

          2. Task notes saying 'Already implemented' created false confidence without actual
          validation

          3. Unclear when 'implementation + tests' means 'just add tests' vs 'implement everything'


          Search Results:

          - Friction #1 is already tracked in inbox @01KFST4H (Automation Eligibility Default Fix)

          - Friction #2 is a pattern worth capturing as observation

          - Friction #3 is covered by existing task-work skill guidance on verification

          High-Confidence Items Identified:


          SUCCESS:

          1. Verification-first prevents wasted implementation effort (pattern seen in this session
          and documented in task-work skill)


          FRICTION:

          1. Task notes saying 'Already implemented' without actual validation creates false
          confidence
             - This session: Task @01KFQAG8 had implementation already complete but needed validation to confirm
             - Pattern: Notes are historical context, not proof of current state
             - Already partially covered in task-work skill but worth reinforcing

          LOW CONFIDENCE (skipping):

          - Web UI automation eligibility issue already tracked in inbox @01KFST4H

          - Task scope ambiguity is situational, not systemic


          Items to capture:

          1. Friction observation about task notes vs validation

          Session review complete. 


          What worked:

          - Test-first approach with 23 comprehensive tests (captured as success observation
          @01KFTESK)

          - Following existing ralph patterns for CLI commands via spawnSync

          - Clear spec with 9 ACs made implementation straightforward


          Friction encountered:

          - TypeScript union type handling (already tracked in observation
          @01KF93Q9S85XSBT1JVV1S1F9F3)

          - Minor: ActiveTaskSummary ref→ulid resolution (project-specific, not systemic)


          High-confidence capture:

          - @01KFTESK: Test-first development success pattern


          No additional items to capture - friction already tracked, session successful.

          Evaluation against existing state:

          1. Test-first development success pattern:
             - Status: CAPTURED as @01KFTESK
             - Unique: Yes (no existing observation about test-first specifically)
             - High confidence: Yes (clear pattern with concrete benefits)

          2. Following existing code patterns (spawnSync):
             - Status: SKIP - too general
             - Reason: Not specific enough, already implied by codebase consistency

          3. TypeScript union type friction:
             - Status: SKIP - already tracked
             - Reference: @01KF93Q9S85XSBT1JVV1S1F9F3

          Final tally:

          1. Friction: Task scope/time estimation missing from eligibility - Related to existing
          eligibility system but addresses different dimension (time vs. complexity)

          2. Friction: DoD not visible during task selection - Unique issue

          3. Success: Partial progress commits valuable in loops - Demonstrated this iteration
          (fd70b86d)  

          4. Success: Comprehensive session-end notes enable clean handoffs - Pattern worth

          Session review complete. Key findings:


          Friction (already captured):

          - @01KFTGKV documents web UI E2E tasks marked automation:eligible despite daemon
          dependency


          Additional friction (high confidence, not yet captured):

          1. Loop failure count not queryable - Had to manually grep notes for [LOOP-FAIL:N]
          patterns

          2. Large-scope tasks in automation queue - No mechanism to flag tasks as too large before
          attempting


          Success patterns:

          - Loop correctly identified blockers early and exited cleanly

          - Clean handoff documentation for partial-progress tasks


          Search performed: automation/daemon, loop/fail, task/scope - no existing coverage for
          items 1-2.

          Baseline search complete:


          Observations: 13+ unresolved, mostly success patterns. @01KFTGKV (created this session)
          covers web UI E2E automation eligibility issue.


          Inbox: 75 items reviewed. None directly address loop failure counting or task scope sizing
          for automation.


          Tasks: Searched for loop/fail/automation/scope keywords - no existing tasks covering the
          friction points identified.


          Ready to identify high-confidence items in next step.

          High-confidence friction identified:


          1. Loop failure count not programmatically queryable
             - Concrete: Had to grep task notes for [LOOP-FAIL:N] pattern to determine if task hit 3-failure threshold
             - Systemic: This will recur every loop iteration checking task failure status
             - Certainty: HIGH - experienced directly this session
             - Existing coverage: None found
             - Decision: CAPTURE as observation (friction)

          2. Large-scope tasks lack pre-screening
             - Concrete: @01KFMMXF export task estimated 300-500 lines, not suitable for single iteration
             - Systemic: Pattern will recur with any complex feature in automation queue
             - Certainty: MEDIUM - based on one instance, but clear pattern
             - Existing coverage: None found
             - Decision: SKIP (medium confidence, needs more evidence)

          Existing coverage confirmed:

          - Web UI E2E automation eligibility: Already captured in @01KFTGKV (created this session)


          No high-confidence success patterns beyond what's already documented.

        notes: "Session review complete. Success: Loop error handling worked as designed with [LOOP-FAIL:N]
          tracking and proper escalation. Friction: Initially unclear that auto-escalation happens
          at Ralph orchestration level, not task-work subagent level - but this is correct design.

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **E2E test batch completion** - Successfully completed 4 tasks in one session by
          grouping related E2E tests (observations, errors, navigation) into a single PR #246

          2. **Pattern reuse** - Using page.route() to mock API responses for error handling tests
          was effective and doesn't require daemon running

          3. **PR merge workflow** - Successfully merged PR #245 with automated quality gates

          4. **Existing implementation leverage** - Found AC-20, AC-21, AC-22 already implemented,
          just needed test IDs and tests

          5. **Proper task trailers** - All commits included Task/Spec trailers for traceability


          ## Key Success Pattern

          Grouping related E2E test tasks (observations + errors + navigation) into a single PR
          branch avoided context switching and allowed efficient batch completion.

          ## High-Confidence Items Identified


          ### Success Pattern (HIGH CONFIDENCE)

          **Batching related E2E test tasks into single PR**: Completed 3 tasks (@01KFP85D
          observations, @01KFP85G errors, @01KFP85M navigation) in PR #246 on a single feature
          branch. This avoided:

          - Multiple PR context switches

          - Branch management overhead

          - Review fragmentation


          All 3 tasks were related (E2E tests, data-testid attributes) and could share commits.
          Resulted in efficient completion of 4 tasks total in one session.


          ### Friction Points

          After reviewing observations and inbox, identified issues are either:

          - Already documented (branch workflow in @01KFJF6V)

          - Low confidence (daemon blocker known, multiple-tasks-per-PR context-dependent)

          - Not systemic (one-off branch management mistake)


          No high-confidence friction to capture.


          ### Checked Against Baseline

          - Observations: 100+ existing, branch workflow covered

          - Inbox: 75+ items, no direct match for this pattern

          - Tasks: Active tasks cleared


          This success pattern is NOT currently captured and is worth documenting for replication.

          ## Evaluation Against Existing State


          ### Success Pattern: Batching Related E2E Test Tasks

          **Decision: CAPTURE**


          Reasoning:

          - ✅ HIGH CONFIDENCE: Concrete, specific, repeatable pattern

          - ✅ UNIQUE: Not found in observations (searched "multiple tasks PR", "batch tasks",
          "related tasks")

          - ✅ SYSTEMIC: Applicable to future E2E test implementation work

          - ✅ Clear benefit: Reduced overhead, faster completion, cleaner review


          This pattern succeeded where:

          - Tasks are tightly related (all E2E tests + data-testid)

          - Share common files (same components, test infrastructure)

          - Can be reviewed together (coherent scope)


          Capture as: meta observe success

          Session review complete. Main friction points identified:


          1. E2E daemon requirement blocking automation loops - Already tracked in @01KFTJNA

          2. Automation-eligible tasks lacking scope/time estimates - Already tracked in @01KFTFWF


          Success pattern (iteration state preservation via detailed notes) observed but too
          session-specific for high-confidence capture.


          Session reinforced existing observations: @01KFP84N and @01KFP84S hit daemon blocker
          (extending @01KFTJNA pattern), @01KFQAGY hit scope estimation issue (validating
          @01KFTFWF).


          No new high-confidence items to capture. Existing observations are well-formulated and
          this session provides additional evidence for their validity.

          High-confidence friction and success review:


          FRICTION POINTS IDENTIFIED:

          1. E2E tests requiring daemon for verification - ALREADY CAPTURED as @01KFTJNA
             - Concrete: Tasks @01KFP84N, @01KFP84S stalled at 80%+ complete
             - Systemic: Repeats across all web UI E2E test tasks
             - Already documented with potential solutions

          2. Automation-eligible tasks exceeding single-iteration scope - ALREADY CAPTURED as
          @01KFTFWF
             - Concrete: @01KFQAGY required 60-90min multi-file coordination
             - Systemic: No scope/time estimation in eligibility criteria
             - Already documented with suggestion for estimated_effort field

          SUCCESS PATTERNS:

          - Detailed checkpoint notes preserving state across iterations
            CONFIDENCE: Medium-low - Works for this session but may not generalize
            DECISION: Skip capture (not high-confidence enough for loop mode)

          CONCLUSION: All high-confidence patterns already tracked. Session validates existing
          observations @01KFTJNA and @01KFTFWF.

          Capture phase: No items to capture.


          All high-confidence patterns from this session were already tracked:

          - E2E daemon friction -> @01KFTJNA

          - Scope estimation friction -> @01KFTFWF


          Session outcome: Validates existing observations rather than identifying new patterns.
          This is a successful reflection - confirming that previously identified friction is
          systemic (recurring across multiple sessions/tasks).


          Reflection complete.

          Analysis complete. Evaluated potential captures:

          1. 'Loop summary command' - LOW confidence (single observation, not systemic)
          2. 'Workflow run cleanup' - SKIP (cleanup mechanism exists, just environmental)
          3. 'Checkpoint note pattern' - SKIP (already standard practice, not unique)

          **Finding:** No high-confidence friction or success patterns identified.

          Session demonstrated existing patterns working correctly:
          - automation:needs_review tagging worked as designed
          - Task notes provided good handoff context
          - Loop exited cleanly when no eligible work remained

          ## Session Review


          **What Worked:**

          - Automation loop exit logic correctly identified tasks requiring daemon/human
          intervention

          - Task failure tracking and auto-escalation to automation:needs_review worked as designed

          - Comprehensive exit notes documented state for human handoff


          **Friction Points:**

          1. No progress across 17 iterations - all 3 in_progress tasks repeatedly assessed but none
          completed

          2. E2E test daemon requirement creates hard stop (already tracked in @01KFMMZW)

          3. Gap between automation:eligible tag and actual automation feasibility


          **Existing Coverage:**

          - E2E daemon testing blocked: @01KFMMZW

          - Automation eligibility: @task-automation-eligibility spec

          - Ralph loop successes: Multiple observations


          **High-Confidence Capture:**

          - Friction pattern: Automation loop with no completions across 17 iterations (new pattern
          distinct from prior successes)
      - step_index: 1

          ✅ Automation loop exit logic - Correctly escalated 3 tasks to automation:needs_review
          after identifying daemon/multi-file requirements exceeded loop capacity. Clean exit with
          comprehensive handoff notes.


          **FRICTION (systemic issue):**

          ✅ Zero-completion automation sessions - Loop spent 17 iterations assessing same 3 tasks
          without completing any work. All tasks escalated to needs_review. Distinct from prior
          Ralph loop sessions which showed steady PR completions.


          Root cause: Tasks marked automation:eligible but requiring:

          - Running daemon for E2E test verification (2 tasks)

          - Multi-file coordinated implementation (1 task)


          **NOT capturing (already tracked):**

          - E2E daemon testing framework decision → blocked task @01KFMMZW

          - Automation eligibility spec → @task-automation-eligibility exists


          **Confidence level:** HIGH - This is concrete, repeatable, specific pattern with clear
          cause/effect.

          ## Evaluation Against Existing State


          **Item 1: Success pattern - Automation loop exit logic**

          - Search results: Multiple Ralph loop success observations exist (01KFCTE1, 01KFDPM7,
          etc.)

          - Comparison: Those observations document PR completions. This documents clean EXIT when
          no work possible.

          - Decision: CAPTURE - Distinct success pattern (graceful exit vs completion)


          **Item 2: Friction - Zero-completion automation sessions**  

          - Search results: No existing observation about loops that complete zero work

          - Prior observations: Focus on successful completions

          - Decision: CAPTURE - Unique friction pattern, high confidence


          Both items are:

          ✅ Concrete and specific

          ✅ Systemic/repeatable  

          ✅ Clear cause and effect

          ✅ High confidence

          ✅ Not duplicates of existing items

          ## Captured Items


          **SUCCESS observation @01KFTPYK:**

          Automation loop graceful exit pattern - Clean escalation to automation:needs_review with
          comprehensive handoff notes when tasks exceed loop capacity.


          **FRICTION observation @01KFTPYV:**  

          Zero-completion automation sessions - Gap between automation:eligible tag and actual
          feasibility. Tasks requiring daemon/multi-file work can't complete in single iteration.


          **Total captured:** 2 observations (1 success, 1 friction)

          **Skipped:** E2E daemon framework (already tracked in @01KFMMZW)


          Reflection complete.

          ## What Worked Well


          1. Systematic task complexity assessment before implementation

          2. Correct identification that GitHub Pages tasks form coordinated feature set

          3. Proper automation:needs_review marking with clear reasons

          4. Checkpoint notes documenting state for handoff


          ## Friction Points


          1. **Feature set visibility**: 4 eligible tasks were logically dependent (all GitHub Pages
          export) but no visual indicator or encoding of this relationship

          2. **Session checkpoint redundancy**: Hook required manual notes for tasks that already
          had detailed iteration notes from same session


          ## Search Results


          - Spec-level dependencies: Already tracked in inbox (@spec-level depends_on)

          - Feature set grouping: NOT tracked - new friction pattern

          - Checkpoint redundancy: NOT tracked - new friction pattern

          ## High-Confidence Assessment


          Reviewed friction points and successes against high-confidence criteria:


          **Friction candidates:**

          1. Feature set visibility - LOW confidence (one-time assessment, not recurring)

          2. Checkpoint redundancy - LOW confidence (single occurrence, not systemic)


          **Success candidates:**

          1. Correct automation assessment - ALREADY CAPTURED (@01KFTQJ6 observation)


          **Result:** No new high-confidence items to capture. Session success already documented in
          existing observation.

          ## Capture Decision

          **Items to capture:** None

          **Reasoning:**
          - Success pattern already captured in @01KFTQJ6 (loop iteration 19 assessment)
          - Friction points failed high-confidence criteria (one-time occurrences, not systemic)

          **Outcome:** Skip capture step, workflow complete.

          ## Capture Complete


          **Items captured:** 0


          **Rationale:**

          - No new high-confidence friction or success patterns identified

          - Session success already documented in existing observation @01KFTQJ6

          - Avoided capturing low-confidence one-off issues per loop mode guidelines


          **Session Summary:**

          Iteration 19 correctly assessed all eligible tasks as exceeding automation capacity. No
          new systemic patterns emerged requiring capture.

          Session Review Complete


          **What Worked Well:**

          1. Exit condition detection - correctly identified no eligible tasks across 25 iterations

          2. Scope assessment - accurately identified tasks exceeding automation capacity

          3. [LOOP-FAIL:N] tracking - 3-failure threshold escalated tasks properly

          4. Note documentation - consistent iteration notes preserved context


          **Friction Points:**

          1. Redundant no-op iterations (19-25) - already tracked in observations @01KFQF5Q,
          @01KFTR74

          2. Stop hook validation requiring duplicate notes - already tracked in observation
          @01KFQ8QR


          All friction points already have observation coverage. No new high-confidence items to
          capture.

          High-Confidence Items Assessment


          **Friction Points:**

          ✅ Redundant no-op loop iterations - ALREADY TRACKED (@01KFQF5Q, @01KFTR74)

          ✅ Stop hook duplicate note requirement - ALREADY TRACKED (@01KFQ8QR)


          **Success Patterns:**

          ✅ [LOOP-FAIL:N] escalation pattern - works as designed, no new observation needed

          ✅ Scope assessment before implementation - standard best practice, no capture needed


          **Result:** Zero new high-confidence items to capture. All systemic friction already
          documented in existing observations. All successes are expected workflow behaviors.

          **Final Result:** ZERO items to capture. All friction already documented, all successes

          Capture Complete


          **Items Captured:** 0 (zero)


          **Reason:** All friction points identified during session review already have observation
          coverage:

          - @01KFQF5Q: Automation loop iterations consumed even when zero eligible tasks exist

          - @01KFTR74: Loop mode runs redundant iterations when no progress possible

          - @01KFQ8QR: Stop hook successfully caught incomplete session cleanup


          **Success Patterns:** All identified successes (exit detection, scope assessment,
          LOOP-FAIL escalation) are expected behaviors of working systems - not novel patterns worth
          documenting.


          **Reflection Quality:** High-confidence filter applied correctly. Better to capture
          nothing than duplicate existing observations or document routine operations.


          Session reflection complete - no new items to track.

          ## Session Review Complete

          **What Worked Well:**
          - Proper automation escalation (tasks marked automation:needs_review)
          - Comprehensive iteration notes documenting exact state
          - Clean exit when no eligible work remained

          **Friction Points Identified:**
          1. Repetitive iteration notes (iterations 23-26, no state changes)
          2. Loop ran 4 iterations with zero progress before exiting

          **Coverage Check:**
          - ✅ @01KFTRRA already covers iteration consumption with no eligible work
          - ✅ @01KFTRY6 already covers redundant iterations with identical notes

          **Conclusion:** All friction already tracked. No new high-confidence items to capture.

          ## High-Confidence Assessment


          **Friction Points Found:**

          1. Repetitive iteration notes - iterations 23-26 added identical notes

          2. No early exit - loop ran 4 iterations with zero eligible work


          **Confidence Level:** High (observed directly in this session)


          **Coverage Against Existing State:**

          - Friction #1: ✅ Covered by @01KFTRY6 (redundant iterations)  

          - Friction #2: ✅ Covered by @01KFTRRA (iteration consumption)


          **Successes Observed:**

          - Consistent note format (standard practice, not novel)

          - Proper escalation to automation:needs_review (working as designed)


          **Result:** Zero novel high-confidence items identified. All patterns already tracked in
          observations from earlier in this same session.

          What worked:

          - [LOOP-FAIL:N] tracking and auto-escalation to needs_review after 3 failures

          - Infrastructure debugging made real progress (Vite proxy + relative URLs in iteration 5)

          - Clean exit when no automation-eligible tasks available


          Friction points identified:

          1. Daemon doesn't load fixture data with absolute --kspec-dir paths ('{} is not iterable'
          error)

          2. Task @01KFQAGY scope mismatch - marked as implementation but requires multi-hour
          greenfield work

          3. E2E test debugging took 5 iterations to find root cause


          Coverage check:

          - Daemon fixture issue: documented in task notes but no discrete task/observation

          - Scope assessment: no existing observation

          - E2E debugging: partially covered by @01KFQ8VE (health check) but not the systemic
          pattern

          HIGH CONFIDENCE friction point:

             - Specific: '{} is not iterable' error when E2E tests use test-base.ts fixtures
             - Systemic: Blocks all E2E tests for web UI (@01KFP84N, @01KFP84S)
             - Clear cause: Daemon's data loading logic doesn't handle absolute paths correctly
             - Not already captured: Task notes document symptom but no discrete task/observation exists

          Reasoning:

          - NOT a duplicate - no existing task/observation for this specific bug

          - High confidence - reproduced consistently across E2E test runs

          - Actionable - needs debugging of ContextManager initialization

          - Systemic - blocks all web UI E2E test tasks

          Session review complete.

          **What Worked:**
          - Proper escalation: Tasks correctly marked automation:needs_review after 3 failures
          - Comprehensive notes: Each iteration documented blockers clearly
          - Clean exit detection: Loop identified when no eligible work remains

          **Friction Points Identified:**
          1. Loop ran 10 iterations with zero code changes, just note updates
          2. Daemon fixture loading blocker never investigated/debugged
          3. Greenfield tasks immediately escalated without decomposition attempt
          4. Iteration waste - same blockers documented repeatedly

          **Existing Coverage Found:**
          - Daemon fixture issue tracked in @01KFVRXRER (pending task)
          - Loop efficiency issues tracked in observations @01KFTRRAAF, @01KFTRY6AS, @01KFTSWYG7
          - E2E verification blockers tracked in @01KFTJNAK and others

          **Conclusion:**
          All major friction points already tracked. No high-confidence new items to capture.

          **High-Confidence Friction:**
          All identified friction points have existing tracking:
          - Loop iteration waste → @01KFTRRAAF, @01KFTRY6AS, @01KFTSWYG7 (observations)
          - Daemon fixture loading → @01KFVRXRER (pending task)
          - E2E verification blockers → @01KFTJNAK, @01KFTGC48, @01KFTHK60 (observations)

          **High-Confidence Success:**
          - Escalation tagging working correctly (automation:needs_review after 3 failures)
          - Note-taking provides clear audit trail for human sessions
          - Exit condition detection prevents infinite loops

          **Decision:**
          No new items to capture - all friction already tracked, successes are expected behavior.

          **What Worked Well:**

          1. Automation tagging correctly identified tasks requiring human intervention

          2. Exit condition logic properly recognized no eligible tasks remain

          3. Session checkpoint notes provided comprehensive state documentation


          **Friction Points Identified:**

          1. Loop iterations consumed even when zero eligible work exists (already tracked in
          @01KFTRRA)

          2. No granularity in automation:needs_review tag to distinguish debugging vs design work
          (low confidence - unclear if valuable enough to warrant complexity)


          **Search Results:**

          - Friction point #1: Already covered by observation @01KFTRRA

          - Friction point #2: Not tracked but uncertain if worth capturing


          **Decision:**

          Nothing new to capture - all high-confidence friction already documented in existing
          observations.

          Step 2: Identify high-confidence items.


          After searching existing observations, tasks, and inbox:


          **High-Confidence Findings:**

          NONE - All friction points from this session are already tracked:

          - Loop iterations with zero eligible work → @01KFTRRA (exact match)

          - Automation tag disconnect → @01KFVSKK (related but now resolved)


          **Low-Confidence Items (NOT capturing):**

          - More granular automation tags (needs_review_debug vs needs_review_design): Uncertain if
          valuable enough to warrant complexity. Would require schema changes and unclear if it
          would actually improve loop behavior.


          **Successes Worth Noting:**

          - Loop exit logic working correctly (exited on 0 eligible tasks)

          - Session checkpoint hook enforcing note-taking worked well

          - Comprehensive search via 'kspec search' found existing coverage quickly


          **Conclusion:**

          Nothing new to capture. Session had expected friction (zero eligible work) that is already
          well-documented in the observation system.

          **What Worked Well:**

          1. Clear exit conditions - loop correctly identified no eligible tasks

          2. Session checkpoint hooks caught incomplete work and prompted documentation

          3. Task notes provide complete iteration history for debugging


          **Friction Points:**

          1. Loop spinning: 12 iterations with zero code changes, tasks stayed in_progress

          2. Daemon fixture loading blocker persisted across all iterations (already tracked:

          HIGH CONFIDENCE FRICTION IDENTIFIED:


          1. **Ralph loop iteration without code changes** (UNIQUE + HIGH CONFIDENCE)
             - Pattern: Loop ran 12 consecutive iterations, all exiting with 'no eligible tasks'
             - Zero git commits or code modifications across all 12 iterations
             - Tasks remained in_progress state throughout
             - All task notes document 'no work attempted this iteration'
             - Systemic: This will recur whenever tasks are marked needs_review but not properly excluded
             - NOT duplicate: @01KF554T describes circuit breaker CONCEPT but actual behavior pattern not captured as observation
             - CAPTURE AS: friction observation

          SUCCESS PATTERN:

          2. **Session checkpoint hook enforcement** (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
             - Pattern: Stop hook caught incomplete work state and forced documentation
             - All 3 in_progress tasks received checkpoint notes documenting state
             - Systemic: Hook runs every session end, ensures state is documented

          ## What Worked Well

          - Task checkpoint notes added systematically to all 3 in_progress tasks

          - Correctly identified no automation-eligible tasks and exited cleanly

          - Clear documentation of blockers for each task


          ## Friction Points Identified

          1. 13 consecutive iterations with zero code changes or git commits

          2. Automation tags not being updated despite notes documenting intent

          3. No circuit breaker to detect repeated no-progress iterations


          ## Coverage Check Complete

          All friction points already tracked:

          - @01KFVTBAYZ7S0403M97E2XG31T: Ralph loop without progress pattern (12 iterations, same as

          High-confidence assessment: NO new items to capture


          All friction patterns from this session already have comprehensive coverage:


          1. **Zero-progress loop iterations** - Already captured in @01KFVTBAYZ7S0403M97E2XG31T
          (describes 12 iterations, identical to this session's 13)


          2. **Automation tag documentation without execution** - Already captured in
          @01KFVSKKCZVQ2K2BRJMT0A86WP (exact pattern observed)


          3. **Missing circuit breaker** - Already in inbox @01KF554T (Ralph design includes circuit
          breaker concept)


          **Success patterns:**

          - Systematic checkpoint documentation worked correctly

          - Clean exit when no eligible tasks remain


          These success patterns are minor/expected behavior - not worth capturing separately.

          Session Review Complete:


          **What Worked:**

          - Automation eligibility filtering correctly identified zero eligible tasks

          - Task automation:needs_review tagging prevented infinite retry loops

          - Clean exit logic when no work available

          - Comprehensive checkpoint notes maintained context


          **Friction Identified:**

          1. Circuit breaker for zero-progress iterations - ALREADY TRACKED (@01KF554T inbox,
          @01KFVTBA observation)

          2. Repetitive checkpoint note writing - Same message written 14x3=42 times

          3. No distinguishing between 'no tasks available' vs 'all tasks too complex'


          **Coverage Check:**

          - Circuit breaker: Already tracked in inbox and observations

          - Repetitive notes: Not tracked yet

          - Task complexity detection: Not tracked yet


          **High-confidence captures:**

          None - the main friction (circuit breaker) is already well-tracked. The repetitive notes
          issue is minor and session-specific rather than systemic.

          High-Confidence Assessment:


          **Friction Points:**

          1. Circuit breaker missing - HIGH CONFIDENCE but ALREADY TRACKED (@01KF554T, @01KFVTBA)
             - Observed: 14 iterations with zero work, no auto-stop
             - Systemic: Will happen any time all tasks are needs_review
             - Concrete: Need max_idle_iterations threshold

          2. Repetitive checkpoint notes - LOW CONFIDENCE for capture
             - Specific to this session's unusual circumstance (14 zero-work iterations)
             - Not a systemic pattern under normal operation
             - Skip capture

          3. Task complexity vs availability detection - LOW CONFIDENCE
             - Theoretical problem, not observed friction
             - Current system works: tasks tagged needs_review appropriately
             - Skip capture

          **Success Patterns:**

          1. Automation eligibility filtering - HIGH CONFIDENCE
             - Pattern: --eligible flag on tasks ready prevents wasted work
             - Worked perfectly: Returned empty array, loop exited cleanly
             - Worth documenting: Already working as designed

          **Conclusion:**

          Zero high-confidence items need capture. Main friction already tracked, minor issues not
          systemic.

          Decision Matrix Applied:

          **Friction Point 1: Circuit breaker for zero-progress loops**
          - Status: SKIP - Already tracked in @01KF554T (inbox) and @01KFVTBA (observation)
          - Confidence: High
          - Action: None needed, existing coverage is comprehensive

          **Friction Point 2: Repetitive checkpoint notes**
          - Status: SKIP - Low confidence, session-specific issue
          - Reason: Not systemic, only occurs during extended zero-work periods
          - Action: None

          **Friction Point 3: Task complexity detection**
          - Status: SKIP - Low confidence, theoretical problem
          - Reason: Current system handles this correctly via needs_review tagging
          - Action: None

          **Success Pattern 1: Automation eligibility filtering**
          - Status: SKIP - Working as designed
          - Reason: No action needed, system functioning correctly
          - Action: None

          **Final Assessment:**
          Zero items require capture. All observed friction either already tracked or not systemic.

          Capture Complete:


          **Items Captured:** 0


          **Reasoning:**

          - All identified friction points already tracked in existing observations/inbox

          - No unique high-confidence patterns emerged from this session

          - Session was primarily validation that automation loop correctly handles 'no eligible
          work' scenario


          **Existing Coverage Confirmed:**

          - @01KF554T (inbox): Circuit breaker design for loop mode

          - @01KFVTBA (observation): Actual observation of 12-iteration zero-progress pattern


          **Outcome:**

          Clean session with proper exit behavior. No new learnings requiring capture.

          ## What Worked Well

          1. Exit condition enforcement - 15 iterations, zero false work attempts

          2. Task escalation accuracy - all tasks correctly tagged needs_review

          3. Note quality - comprehensive status documentation every iteration

          4. No premature exits - loop correctly identified no eligible work


          ## Friction Points Identified

          1. **Loop continues after escalation** - Once task marked needs_review, loop still checks
          it every iteration (15x same status)

          2. **Existing observation found** - @01KFMMZW documents automation tag disconnect pattern


          ## Search Results

          - kspec search 'automation needs_review': Found existing observation @01KFMMZW

          - kspec search 'loop exit': Found completed task about exit conditions

          - kspec search 'daemon debug': Only found blocked tasks, no systemic tracking

          - kspec search 'repetitive checking': No existing coverage

          - kspec search 'loop iteration efficiency': No existing coverage


          High-confidence friction: Loop inefficiency when all tasks are escalated (continues
          checking instead of early exit)

          ## High-Confidence Friction Point


          **Pattern:** Loop continues iterating when all active tasks are automation:needs_review


          **Specifics:**

          - 15 consecutive iterations (iteration 1-15)

          - Each iteration: runs 'kspec tasks ready --eligible', finds 0 tasks, adds note to all 3
          tasks

          - Pattern is systemic: happens every time all tasks escalated

          - Cost: unnecessary API calls, note bloat, slower exit


          **Root Cause:** Exit condition checks 'kspec tasks ready --eligible' but continues
          documenting status on needs_review tasks


          **Ideal Behavior:** Exit immediately when no eligible tasks remain, without additional
          status notes


          **Confidence Level:** HIGH - directly observed across 15 iterations this session


          **Check Against Search:**

          - Not covered by existing observation @01KFMMZW (different issue - tag disconnect)

          - Not covered by completed task about exit conditions (that fixed filtering, not early
          exit)


          ## High-Confidence Success


          **Pattern:** Task escalation with comprehensive rationale prevents false work


          **Specifics:**

          - All 3 tasks tagged needs_review with multi-paragraph explanation

          - Zero attempted implementations when work wasn't eligible

          - Notes document WHAT blocks, WHY it's not automatable, WHAT human needs to do


          **Confidence Level:** HIGH - clear evidence in task notes, zero false work attempts

          ## Decision Matrix


          ### Friction: Loop continues after all tasks escalated

          - **Unique?** YES - not covered by existing items

          - **High confidence?** YES - observed 15 times this session

          - **Specific?** YES - clear cause (exit checks eligible, doesn't skip notes), clear effect
          (wasted iterations)

          - **Decision:** CAPTURE as friction observation


          ### Success: Task escalation with comprehensive rationale

          - **Unique?** YES - not tracked as success pattern

          - **High confidence?** YES - clear evidence in notes

          - **Specific?** YES - multi-paragraph explanations prevented false work

          - **Decision:** CAPTURE as success observation


          Both items meet capture criteria (ac-4).

          ## Captured

          Created 2 observations:

          1. **Friction (@01KFVTYS):** Ralph loop inefficiency when all tasks escalated
             - Pattern: continues checking after no eligible work found
             - Evidence: 15 consecutive iterations adding repetitive notes
             - Impact: API waste, note bloat, slower completion

          2. **Success (@01KFVTYW):** Comprehensive task escalation rationale
             - Pattern: multi-paragraph explanations prevent false work
             - Evidence: zero inappropriate work attempts across 15 iterations
             - Impact: quality handoffs to human sessions

          Both observations meet high-confidence criteria (concrete, systemic, clear cause/effect).
          No low-confidence or duplicate items attempted.

          ## Session Review (Iterations 1-16)


          **What Worked Well:**

          1. Escalation decisions - Loop correctly identified all 3 in_progress tasks exceeded
          automation scope

          2. Exit condition logic - Properly recognized no eligible work remained and exited cleanly

          3. Documentation quality - Comprehensive notes explaining why tasks weren't
          automation-eligible


          **Friction Points:**

          1. Zero productive work across 16 iterations - Loop ran 16 times checking same 3 tasks
          already marked needs_review

          2. Redundant note spam - 24 nearly-identical notes added across iterations 9-16 saying 'no
          eligible tasks'

          3. No learning mechanism - Loop doesn't recognize when it's checked same task multiple
          times


          **Already Tracked:**

          - Loop exit condition fixed in PR #247 (task @01KFV6CZ - completed)

          - Redundant notes/early termination tracked in observation @01KFTSWYG75X3E38BWWRK8HBWQ

          - Daemon fixture loading tracked in task @01KFVRXRER8NHHSXQRCGJNWJD5


          **Conclusion:**

          All friction points from this session are already tracked. No new captures needed.

          ## High-Confidence Items Assessment


          **Friction Points:**

          All friction points identified are already tracked:

          1. Loop exit condition → Fixed in PR #247 (@01KFV6CZ)

          2. Redundant notes/early termination → Tracked in observation @01KFTSWYG75X3E38BWWRK8HBWQ

          3. Daemon fixture loading → Tracked in task @01KFVRXRER8NHHSXQRCGJNWJD5


          **Success Patterns:**

          1. Loop escalation logic correctly identified tasks exceeding automation scope - but this
          is expected behavior, not a novel pattern worth capturing

          2. Comprehensive exit notes improved accountability - also expected behavior per workflow
          design


          **Conclusion:**

          No high-confidence items requiring new capture. All friction already tracked, successes
          are expected behaviors.

          High-confidence items identified and captured:


          SUCCESS: Session checkpoint note pattern - detailed state documentation across 10
          iterations provided excellent continuity and audit trail


          FRICTION 1: Loop stagnation - 10 iterations with zero progress after tasks marked
          needs_review. Exit logic only checks task existence, not progress metrics (commits, file
          changes, state transitions)


          FRICTION 2: Infrastructure debugging approach - Daemon fixture loading blocker persisted
          10 iterations with no alternative debugging attempted (manual daemon inspection, code path
          tracing, minimal reproduction)

          What worked well:

          - Automation eligibility filtering respected automation:needs_review flags

          - Exit condition properly enforced when no eligible tasks remained  

          - Boundary recognition: tasks escalated for legitimate reasons (infrastructure debugging,
          architectural decisions)

          - Already captured in observation @01KFVVHG


          Friction points identified:

          - Redundant loop iterations (19 iterations, no state changes)

          - Verbose checkpoint notes repeated across iterations

          - No early exit detection


          All friction already tracked:

          - Redundant iterations: @01KFTRY6, @01KFTRRAAF, @01KFVTBA

          ## Session Review Complete


          **What Worked Well:**

          1. Automation escalation correctly identified non-automatable tasks (iterations 7-8)

          2. Exit condition properly triggered when no eligible tasks remained (iteration 20)

          3. Checkpoint notes provided comprehensive state documentation

          4. Session hook validation ensured in-progress tasks were documented


          **Friction Points Identified:**

          1. Loop ran 13 redundant iterations (9-20) after tasks escalated in iterations 7-8

          2. Each redundant iteration added identical checkpoint notes with only iteration number
          changing

          3. No early exit despite zero eligible tasks and zero state changes across multiple
          iterations


          **Existing Coverage:**

          - Two unresolved friction observations already document this pattern

          - Task @01KFV6CZ fixed related issue (filtering in_progress by automation eligibility) but
          didn't address redundant iterations

          - No task or inbox item exists to implement early exit optimization


          **High-Confidence Capture:**

          None - friction already documented in existing observations. No new patterns identified
          that warrant additional capture.

          ## Search Results Baseline


          **Current State:**

          - Observations: 322 total

          - Inbox items: 77 total

          - Active tasks: 15 (pending + in_progress)


          **Specific Search for Session Friction:**

          Already searched and found:

          - 2 unresolved friction observations about redundant loop iterations

          - Task @01KFV6CZ (completed) addressed related but different issue

          - No inbox items about loop early exit optimization


          **High-Confidence Items for This Session:**

          None identified. All friction patterns from this session are already documented in
          existing observations.


          **Reasoning:**

          Session consisted of 13 redundant iterations (9-20) after proper escalation in iterations
          7-8. This pattern is already captured in existing friction observations. Adding another
          observation would be duplicate tracking.

          ## Evaluation Against Existing State


          **Items Considered:**

          1. **Redundant loop iterations after task escalation**
             - Status: SKIP - Already tracked
             - Reference: 2 existing unresolved friction observations
             - Pattern: Loop continues running checkpoint iterations when no eligible tasks remain
             - This session: 13 redundant iterations (9-20) confirms existing observation

          **Decision:**

          No new items to capture. All friction from this session confirms patterns already
          documented in existing observations.


          **Session Value:**

          - Validated automation escalation works correctly

          - Confirmed loop exit condition functions as designed

          - Added data point to existing friction observation (another session with redundant
          iterations)

          - Demonstrated proper task state documentation via checkpoint notes

          ## Capture Complete


          **Items Captured:** 0


          **Reasoning:**

          All friction patterns identified in this session are already documented in existing
          unresolved observations. No unique high-confidence patterns emerged.


          **Session Summary:**

          - 20-iteration automated loop session

          - 3 tasks correctly escalated to automation:needs_review

          - Loop properly exited when no eligible tasks remained

          - Friction (redundant iterations) already tracked in observation system

          - No new captures needed - existing observations remain valid

          Session Review Complete:


          **What Worked Well:**

          - Loop exit condition correctly filtered by automation eligibility

          - Session checkpoint hook enforced documentation before exit

          - Consistent note-taking maintained audit trail across 21 iterations

          - Loop correctly identified all tasks as needs_review and exited cleanly


          **Friction Points Identified:**

          1. 21 iterations with zero implementation work - repetitive checkpoint notes

          2. No early detection of 'all tasks blocked' state before running iterations

          3. Iteration budget consumed for no-op documentation work


          **Search Results:**

          All friction points already captured in existing observations:

          - @01KFVVATF0YA11E7EB88TAHP3X - loop stagnation detection

          - @01KFTR8FDCNMBT7P0VNN8SDBSW - repetitive checkpoint notes

          - @01KFTRY6ASB4AHM7D0ZTP2HX68 - redundant iterations when blocked


          **Success Pattern:**

          Loop escalation discipline validated - observation @01KFVVHGHH2Q71ECC19CF59E4E documents
          this pattern, session 21 confirms it continues working correctly.

          One success pattern worth reinforcing:

          - Loop escalation discipline continues working correctly (validates
          @01KFVVHGHH2Q71ECC19CF59E4E)

          - Session checkpoint hook enforcement ensures tasks don't silently stall (validates

          **Result:**

          No new high-confidence items to capture - all systemic issues already tracked. Session

          Step 0 Complete - Session Reviewed


          **What worked well:**

          1. Proper escalation: Loop correctly identified tasks exceeding automation scope and
          escalated to needs_review

          2. Exit condition accuracy: Clean exit when no automation-eligible tasks remain

          3. Comprehensive documentation: Each iteration added clear notes explaining status


          **Friction points:**

          1. Session checkpoint hook confusion with automation:needs_review status - ALREADY TRACKED
          (@01KFTHKCY)

          2. No additional high-confidence friction to capture


          **Search performed:**

          - Searched 'automation eligible exit' - no existing coverage

          - Searched 'ralph loop exit' - found @01KFV6CZ (completed fix)

          - Searched 'session checkpoint' - found existing observation @01KFTHKCY


          **Conclusion:**

          Only 1 friction point identified and it's already tracked. No new captures needed.

          **Items evaluated:** 2 total (1 friction, 1 success)


          **Items captured:** 0


          **Reason:**

          All identified patterns are already documented in existing observations:

          - Friction: @01KFTHKCY (checkpoint hook vs automation:needs_review)

          - Success: @01KFVTYW9TT5NNV7JNR0PHRM0R, @01KFVVHGHH2Q71ECC19CF59E4E (escalation
          discipline)


          **Reflection outcome:**

          Session validated existing patterns without introducing new learnings. This is expected
          for iteration 22 of an automation loop - most learnings occur in early iterations.

          ## Step 1: What Worked Well

          1. Clean exit detection - Loop correctly identified zero automation-eligible tasks
          2. State documentation - Comprehensive final notes added to all 3 tasks
          3. Stop hook compliance - All tasks had proper checkpoint documentation

          ## Step 2: Friction Points

          None identified. This was a verification iteration confirming proper escalation state.

          ## Assessment

          This session (iteration 24) demonstrates loop mode working as designed:
          - Checked for eligible work
          - Found none (all tasks at automation:needs_review)
          - Documented state
          - Exited cleanly

          No new patterns or friction to capture.

          ## High-Confidence Items


          **None identified.**


          This was a verification iteration (loop iteration 24) with no work attempted. No friction
          encountered, no new success patterns discovered.


          Existing observations already cover:

          - Session checkpoint hook enforcement (obs exists)

          - Loop mode escalation discipline (obs exists)

          - Session checkpoint note quality (obs exists)


          ## Decision


          Skip capture step - no high-confidence new learnings from this iteration.

          **Nothing captured** - no items passed evaluation in step 3.


          This session was a clean verification iteration demonstrating loop mode exit logic working
          correctly. No new patterns emerged that aren't already documented.


          ## Session Outcome


          Loop iteration 24: Verified all active tasks properly escalated to
          automation:needs_review, documented final state, exited cleanly. Reflection complete with
          no captures needed.

          **Session 25 Review Complete**


          **What Worked Well:**

          1. Clean exit detection - correctly identified no eligible work remains via kspec tasks
          ready --eligible

          2. Proper state documentation - added detailed notes explaining task escalation reasoning

          3. Session checkpoint hook guidance - caught missing documentation, prompted proper
          cleanup


          **Friction Points Identified:**

          1. Session checkpoint triggered at exit requiring retroactive notes

          2. Two-pass documentation (exit notes + final state docs)


          **Existing Coverage Check:**

          - Session checkpoint friction: Already tracked in 4+ observations (01KF96V9, 01KFTHKC,
          01KFVTBK, 01KFVVB2)

          - Loop exit patterns: Tracked in @01KFV6CZ (completed task) and observations

          - Task escalation: Extensively tracked in 40+ items including observations 01KFVTYW,
          01KFVVHG


          **Conclusion:**

          All friction and success patterns from this session are already comprehensively tracked.
          No new high-confidence items to capture.

          **High-Confidence Assessment:**


          After searching existing state (observations, inbox, tasks), ALL patterns from session 25
          are already tracked:


          **Friction:**

          - Session checkpoint requiring retroactive notes → Already in observations 01KFTHKC,
          01KFVTBK, 01KFVVB2

          - Two-pass documentation pattern → Consequence of checkpoint hook, covered by same
          observations


          **Successes:**

          - Clean exit via kspec tasks ready --eligible → Implementation tracked in @01KFV6CZ,
          observations 01KFTPYK

          - Proper task escalation with rationale → Observations 01KFVTYW, 01KFVVHG


          **No new high-confidence items identified.** All systemic patterns from this session have
          existing coverage in the system.

          **Evaluation Against Existing State:**


          No unique high-confidence items identified. All patterns from session 25 match existing
          tracked items:


          1. Session checkpoint friction → SKIP (refs: 01KF96V9, 01KFTHKC, 01KFVTBK, 01KFVVB2)

          2. Loop exit detection → SKIP (ref: @01KFV6CZ, 01KFTPYK)

          3. Task escalation discipline → SKIP (refs: 01KFVTYW, 01KFVVHG)

          existing observations and tasks.


          Session 25 was a clean exit iteration with proper state documentation. The system's
          existing observability captured the relevant patterns in previous sessions.

          ## Step 1: What Worked Well


          1. Clean exit detection - kspec tasks ready --eligible correctly identified no
          automation-eligible tasks

          2. Proper escalation tracking - Tasks marked automation:needs_review excluded from
          eligible tasks

          3. State documentation pattern - Comprehensive notes on all in_progress tasks

          4. Stop hook validation - Session checkpoint hook validated all tasks have recent notes


          ## Step 2: Friction Points


          1. Repetitive state documentation - Added nearly identical notes to 3 tasks every
          iteration (26 iterations total)

          2. No bulk note operations - Cannot add same contextual note to multiple related tasks

          3. Hook false positive - Stop hook alerts about in_progress tasks even when properly
          documented with automation:needs_review


          ## Step 3: Search Results


          - Friction #1: Partially covered by @01KF8TQ5 (bulk operations) but doesn't specifically
          mention bulk notes

          - Friction #2: Same as #1

          - Friction #3: Already tracked in observation @01KFTHKCY5 (session checkpoint with
          automation:needs_review)


          ## High-Confidence Captures


          Only one new item worth capturing:

          - Bulk note operation: kspec task note @ref1 @ref2 @ref3 'shared note content' for loop
          iteration tracking

          ## High-Confidence Friction

          **Bulk note operations for loop iteration tracking**
          - Concrete: Need to add same 'Loop iteration N - exit' note to 3 tasks every iteration
          - Systemic: Repeated across 26 iterations, will continue in future loop sessions
          - Cause/effect: No bulk operation → manual repetition of identical commands
          - Certainty: 100% - personally experienced 78 times this session (3 tasks × 26 iterations)

          **Search coverage:** Partially tracked
          - @01KF8TQ5 covers bulk operations generally (transaction/batch mechanics)
          - Does not mention specific use case: bulk notes for loop iteration tracking
          - Gap: Practical need for 'kspec task note @ref1 @ref2 ... "shared content"'

          ## High-Confidence Success

          None that rise to capture level - patterns already well-established.

          ## Proposed Capture

          Refine @01KF8TQ5 or add new inbox item specifically for bulk note operations

          ## Decision: Capture bulk note operation


          **Evaluation:**

          - Unique? Partially - @01KF8TQ5 covers bulk operations concept, but not this specific use
          case

          - High confidence? Yes - 78 repetitions this session, systemic pattern

          - Actionable? Yes - clear feature request with specific syntax


          **Capture decision:** YES - add new inbox item for bulk note operations


          This is distinct enough from @01KF8TQ5 (transaction mechanics) to warrant separate
          tracking. The use case is simpler: add same note to N tasks without transaction overhead.

          ## Summary


          Session 26 had one high-confidence friction point worth capturing. Other friction (session
          checkpoint hook with automation:needs_review) already tracked in observation @01KFTHKCY5.


          Successes (clean exit detection, escalation tracking) are already established patterns,
          not new discoveries.

          **Step 1-2: Session Review Complete**


          What worked well:

          - Proper escalation discipline (no false completions)

          - Comprehensive handoff documentation for human sessions

          - Clean exit condition detection


          Friction points:

          - Repetitive checkpoint notes across no-progress iterations

          - Loop continues when all tasks are automation:needs_review


          **Step 3: Existing Coverage Check**


          All identified patterns already have observation coverage:

          - Checkpoint note repetition: @01KFTR8FDCNMBT7P0VNN8SDBSW

          - Loop iteration waste: @01KFVTYSJECRND016ZATZ25N3A, @01KFTRRAAF4852S6F5H249P78G

          - Escalation discipline success: @01KFVVHGHH2Q71ECC19CF59E4E


          **Step 4: No New Captures Required**


          All high-confidence observations from this session are already documented in the
          observation system. No new friction/success patterns identified that aren't already
          tracked.

          Session review complete.


          **What Worked Well:**

          1. Session checkpoint hook enforcement - prevented task abandonment, ensured all 3
          in_progress tasks got comprehensive state documentation

          2. Proper task escalation - all 3 tasks correctly marked automation:needs_review with
          clear reasoning (infrastructure debugging, dependency blocking, greenfield implementation
          scope)

          3. Loop exit behavior - correctly identified no eligible tasks remain


          **Friction Points:**

          1. Loop ran 30 iterations with zero task completions - but this may be expected given all
          tasks were escalated early

          2. Daemon fixture loading infrastructure blocker affected 2/3 tasks


          **Next Step:** Search existing coverage for all patterns

          **What Worked Well:**


          1. **Native element approach for click handlers** - Replacing shadcn TableRow with native
          `<tr>` immediately fixed the onclick issue. This pattern is worth remembering for Svelte 5
          + shadcn-svelte.


          2. **Debug element technique** - Adding `{#if state}<div data-testid="debug-...">state
          value</div>{/if}` to verify actual runtime state vs expected state quickly confirmed the
          issue was component-level, not state-level.


          3. **Console log tracing through component hierarchy** - Adding logs at each level
          (TaskList -> TasksPage -> TaskDetail) systematically identified where the reactivity chain
          broke.


          4. **Subagent for deep investigation** - Using a general-purpose subagent with WebSearch
          to research bits-ui Svelte 5 issues found relevant GitHub issues and documentation.


          5. **Incremental test execution** - Running single tests with
          `tests/e2e/tasks.spec.ts:181` rather than the full suite made debugging faster.

          **Friction Points:**


          1. **bits-ui Portal reactivity with Svelte 5** - Major blocker. Sheet/Dialog components
          don't receive prop updates through Portal. Had to try multiple workarounds (stores, custom
          components) none of which fully worked. This is a framework-level issue.


          2. **No clear migration path from Svelte 4 to Svelte 5 event syntax** - Mixing `on:click`
          with `onclick` causes build errors. Had to hunt for all instances and convert manually.


          3. **E2E test feedback loop too slow** - Each test run requires full `npm run build` which
          takes 12+ seconds. No dev mode for E2E testing.


          4. **Stale workflow runs accumulating** - Had to specify workflow ID because there are 40+
          abandoned workflow runs clogging the system.


          5. **Debug information lost between sessions** - Previous session's 30 loop iterations
          created noise notes but didn't leave actionable next steps clearly documented.

          **Coverage Check Results:**


          1. **bits-ui Portal reactivity** - Tracked in @01KFP84N notes but not as a standalone
          item. This is a systemic issue affecting all Sheet/Dialog usage in Svelte 5.


          2. **Svelte 4/5 event syntax migration** - NOT explicitly tracked. Partially covered in
          notes but no inbox item or task for a migration guide.


          3. **E2E test feedback loop** - NOT tracked. No existing item for E2E dev mode or faster
          test iteration.


          4. **Stale workflow runs** - ALREADY TRACKED in inbox item 01KFPH39 and observation
          01KFS6P9. No need to add more.


          5. **Debug information lost between sessions** - Partially tracked in observation 01KF93ND
          about ralph loop state freshness.


          **Untracked friction to propose:**

          - bits-ui Svelte 5 reactivity workaround documentation

          - E2E test dev mode for faster iteration

          **Proposed Improvements:**


          1. **Document bits-ui Svelte 5 workaround pattern**
             - What: Add to AGENTS.md a section on bits-ui Portal issues with Svelte 5 and the workaround (use native elements or custom components for clickable items that need to trigger dialogs)
             - How it helps: Saves future sessions from rediscovering this issue
             - Scope: Small - documentation only

          2. **E2E test dev server mode**
             - What: Configure Playwright to work with vite dev server instead of requiring full build, or add a watch mode for faster iteration
             - How it helps: Reduces test iteration from 12+ seconds to 1-2 seconds
             - Scope: Medium - config changes + potential test fixture updates

          3. **Capture success pattern: Debug element technique**
             - What: Add observation about using conditional debug elements (`{#if state}<div data-testid>`) to verify runtime state
             - How it helps: Documents a useful debugging pattern for Svelte reactivity issues
             - Scope: Small - single observation

          Session review complete. Main work: investigating Svelte 5 SSR reactivity bug where state
          updates but {#if} blocks don't re-render after hydration.


          **What Worked Well:**

          - Debug logging approach (console.log + network interception in tests) quickly identified
          that state WAS updating

          - Systematic elimination of component boundaries to isolate the issue

          - Task notes for documenting investigation progress


          **Friction Points:**

          1. Svelte 5 SSR reactivity - state changes after hydration don't trigger re-renders
          (framework bug, not kspec issue)

          2. E2E test debugging is slow - each test run takes ~30s due to build + daemon startup

          3. No clear way to test if build is actually updated vs cached

          Searched existing state. Friction points identified:


          1. **Svelte 5 SSR reactivity bug** - Already tracked in task notes for @01KFP84N. This is
          a framework bug, not kspec issue. NOT capturing separately.


          2. **E2E test iteration slowness** - One-off observation during debugging, not systemic
          kspec friction. NOT capturing.


          3. **Success pattern: Debug logging approach** - Adding console.log + network interception
          to tests quickly isolated that state WAS updating. This is a general debugging technique,
          not kspec-specific. NOT capturing.


          **Conclusion:** No high-confidence items to capture that aren't already tracked. The main
          friction (Svelte 5 SSR) is documented in task notes. Other observations are either one-off
          or general development practices.

          1. Svelte 5 SSR reactivity - SKIP (already tracked in @01KFP84N task notes, framework bug
          not kspec issue)

          2. E2E test slowness - SKIP (one-off, not systemic kspec friction)

          3. Debug logging success - SKIP (general technique, not kspec-specific)


          **Result:** No items to capture. All friction points either already tracked or not meeting

          ## Session Review


          ### What Worked Well

          1. **Subagent for analysis** - Using Explore agent to analyze task state and codebase gave
          comprehensive context quickly

          2. **Subagent for research** - Svelte 5 SSR/reactivity research provided actionable
          solutions

          3. **Debug element pattern** - Adding temporary debug element to template quickly
          diagnosed that state was being set but template wasn't reading it

          4. **Incremental testing** - Running single test (--grep) instead of full suite saved
          significant time during iteration


          ### Friction Points

          1. **Svelte 5 $state reactivity** - Separate $state variables didn't trigger re-renders;
          needed object pattern + flushSync. This took multiple attempts to diagnose.

          2. **Test fixture gaps** - Missing in_progress task, spec_ref fields caused test failures
          unrelated to implementation

          3. **bits-ui Select component testing** - Tests using getByRole('option') have strict mode
          violations and interaction issues

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Plan mode with detailed plan file** - Having the full plan written out before
          implementation gave clear direction and prevented scope drift


          2. **Checking existing task state first** - Running `kspec task get @01KFP84S` at the
          start showed extensive history/notes which helped understand context


          3. **Reading reference tests (tasks.spec.ts) before writing** - Understanding the patterns
          used in the working Tasks View tests informed the Items View test structure


          4. **Fixing the test fixture systematically** - Adding shadow worktree simulation to
          test-base.ts addressed the daemon's project detection needs


          5. **Documenting blocking issues thoroughly** - When hitting the fixture loading issue,
          documenting exactly what was observed (1 item vs 4 expected) and likely causes helps next
          session

          ## Friction Points


          1. **E2E test fixture loading is fragile** - The test-base.ts setup doesn't properly
          simulate shadow worktree mode. Had to add workaround code to create fake .git file. Tests
          were passing before but fixtures weren't actually loading (masked by conditional guards in
          tests).


          2. **No way to validate fixture ULIDs before runtime** - Invalid Crockford base32 ULIDs
          (containing I, L, O, U) fail silently during schema validation. Had to manually check each
          ULID. The testUlid() helper exists but only for TypeScript tests, not YAML fixtures.


          3. **Parent field not computed during item extraction** - Items are loaded flat from YAML
          but ItemTree expects parent ULIDs. This fundamental gap between data model and UI
          expectations wasn't documented anywhere.


          4. **Daemon startup delay guessing** - test-base.ts uses `await new Promise(r =>
          setTimeout(r, 2000))` to wait for daemon. No health check polling, just hope 2 seconds is
          enough.


          5. **No way to test API responses independently** - Had to run full E2E tests to discover
          items weren't loading. Would be faster to have a way to hit daemon API directly during
          debugging.

          ## Coverage Check Results


          ### Friction 1: E2E test fixture loading fragile

          - **Partially tracked** - @01KFQ8VE5TGYP33H6CVHXBKAQE inbox item mentions health check for
          daemon startup

          - Missing: Shadow worktree simulation requirement not documented


          ### Friction 2: No ULID validation for YAML fixtures  

          - **Not tracked** - testUlid() helper exists for TypeScript but no equivalent for YAML
          fixtures

          - The AGENTS.md documents valid chars but no tooling to validate


          ### Friction 3: Parent field not computed during item extraction

          - **Not tracked** - This is a gap between parser and UI expectations

          - No spec/task covers how hierarchical items should expose parent relationships


          ### Friction 4: Daemon startup delay guessing

          - **Already tracked** - Inbox @01KFQ8VE5TGYP33H6CVHXBKAQE covers this exact issue


          ### Friction 5: No way to test API responses independently

          ## Proposed Improvements (Untracked Friction)


          ### 1. YAML Fixture ULID Validator

          **What:** CLI command or pre-commit hook to validate ULIDs in YAML fixtures

          **How it helps:** Catch invalid Crockford base32 chars before runtime, fail fast with
          clear error

          **Scope:** Small - regex check on all _ulid fields in tests/fixtures/


          ### 2. Document parent field computation requirement

          **What:** Add to AGENTS.md that ItemTree expects parent ULIDs, and document options for
          providing them

          **How it helps:** Prevents confusion when items load flat but UI expects hierarchy

          **Scope:** Small - documentation update


          ### 3. Daemon debug endpoint

          **What:** Add endpoint like GET /api/debug/items that returns raw loaded items with
          validation status

          **How it helps:** Debug fixture loading without running full E2E tests

          **Scope:** Medium - new API endpoint with schema validation details

          ## Session Review


          ### What Worked Well

          1. **Systematic debugging** - Traced schema validation failures methodically (checked ULID
          format, enum values, nested item handling)

          2. **Quick CLI verification** - Using 'kspec item list' in temp directory to verify items
          load before running full E2E tests

          3. **Node debugging script** - Writing quick Node.js one-liners to test schema parsing
          isolated issue quickly

          4. **Screenshot analysis** - Playwright screenshots clearly showed progress (1→2→3→4 items
          visible)


          ### Friction Points Encountered

          1. **Schema validation silently drops invalid items** - No error/warning when
          SpecItemSchema.safeParse fails, items just don't appear. Spent significant time debugging
          why trait wasn't loading.

          2. **Test fixture ULID/schema mismatches** - Fixtures used '_ulid' for acceptance_criteria
          but schema expects 'id'. Also status enum values didn't match schema.

          3. **Nested accordion selectors** - Playwright getByTestId finds all descendants, required
          .first() everywhere for nested tree structures.

          4. **Parser change vs daemon change guidance** - Initially modified parser (wrong
          approach), user correctly redirected to compute parent in daemon layer instead.

          ## High-Confidence Items


          ### Friction: Silent safeParse failures in item extraction

          **Confidence: HIGH** - Encountered multiple times, systemic issue

          **Pattern:** When SpecItemSchema.safeParse() fails, extractItemsFromRaw() silently
          continues. Items just don't appear in results with no error/warning. Caused significant
          debugging time for trait (wrong enum values) and module (nested items in traits field).

          **Search result:** No existing tracking found for this specific silent failure pattern.


          ### Success: Quick Node.js debugging scripts

          **Confidence: HIGH** - Used effectively this session

          **Pattern:** Writing inline Node.js scripts to test schema parsing in isolation: `node -e
          'const result = Schema.safeParse(data); console.log(result.success, result.error)'`

          **Search result:** Similar to 01KFCS35 'Test-first debugging workflow' but more specific.


          ### Friction: Test fixture schema drift

          **Confidence: MEDIUM** - One-off but indicates systemic gap

          **Pattern:** Fixtures used '_ulid' for AC but schema expects 'id'. Status enums also
          mismatched. Fixtures should be validated against schema.

          **Search result:** 01KFBDQE 'Add spec-schema drift detection' is blocked - related but not
          same (that's for spec files, not test fixtures).


          ### Not Capturing (low confidence/one-off):

          - Parser vs daemon layer guidance (was my mistake, user corrected appropriately)

          - Playwright nested selector issues (standard Playwright usage, not kspec-specific)

          - Unique: No existing tracking
          - High confidence: Concrete, systemic, clear cause/effect
          - Action: Capture as friction

          ### 2. Node.js debugging scripts - SKIP
          - Related: 01KFCS35 already captures test-first debugging pattern
          - Not unique enough to warrant separate capture

          ### 3. Test fixture schema drift - SKIP  
          - Related: 01KFBDQE covers spec-schema drift detection (blocked)
          - Medium confidence: One-off issue, may be edge case
          - Could extend existing task rather than new item

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Dedicated E2E fixtures pattern** - Creating separate
          `packages/web-ui/tests/fixtures/` instead of modifying shared fixtures was the right call.
          It isolates E2E tests from unit tests completely.


          2. **Iterative validation approach** - Running `kspec validate` against fixtures in a temp
          dir caught schema errors early (invalid ULIDs, wrong project format, missing files).


          3. **Running targeted tests first** - Testing `items.spec.ts` alone before running the
          full suite helped isolate issues quickly.


          4. **Using subagent for initial context** - Getting task status via subagent at session
          start provided quick context.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **E2E fixture isolation not obvious** - Had to learn the hard way that modifying shared
          `tests/fixtures/` breaks unit tests. No documentation or error message suggested separate
          E2E fixtures.


          2. **ULID validation is silent on invalid characters** - Used "CORE" (contains O) and
          "TRAIT" (contains I) in test ULIDs. Schema validation failed silently without clear
          indication of which character was invalid. The `testUlid()` helper exists but wasn't
          mentioned until late.


          3. **Daemon process cleanup between E2E runs** - Old daemon processes from previous test
          runs blocked new ones. Had to manually find and kill processes. The test-base.ts tries to
          clean up but doesn't always work.


          4. **Background task output retrieval** - Several times `npm run test:e2e` ran in
          background but output file was empty or corrupted. Had to retry with different approaches.


          5. **WebSocket connection tests always fail first** - Every E2E run shows WebSocket
          "Disconnected" on connection tests before other tests pass. Timing-sensitive tests are
          flaky.

          ## Coverage Check


          1. **E2E fixture isolation** - NOT tracked. No existing spec/task/observation mentions
          dedicated E2E fixtures vs shared fixtures.


          2. **ULID validation issues** - ALREADY TRACKED. Multiple observations exist:
             - @01KF94GR: Schema strictness caught ULID issues
             - @01KFCW3T: ULID validation requires Crockford base32
             - @01KFJ7AG: Test fixture ULID validation
             - @01KFQ38Z: testUlid() helper exists

          3. **Daemon cleanup** - NOT tracked. No results for daemon cleanup between tests.


          4. **Background task output** - NOT searched yet (this is Claude Code behavior, not kspec)


          5. **WebSocket test flakiness** - Need to search.

          ## Proposed Improvements (Untracked Only)


          ### 1. Document E2E fixture isolation pattern

          **What:** Add to AGENTS.md or create packages/web-ui/tests/README.md documenting that E2E
          tests use dedicated fixtures at `packages/web-ui/tests/fixtures/` to avoid breaking unit
          tests.

          **How it helps:** Future contributors won't repeat the mistake of modifying shared
          fixtures for E2E needs.

          **Scope:** Small (documentation only)


          ### 2. E2E daemon cleanup improvement  

          **What:** Improve test-base.ts to more aggressively clean up old daemon processes,
          possibly using a unique port per test run or PID tracking.

          **How it helps:** Reduces flaky test failures from orphaned daemons.

          **Scope:** Medium (code change to test infrastructure)


          Note: ULID validation friction is already well-documented in observations. WebSocket
          flakiness is a known issue with the test approach (timing-sensitive).

          ## What Worked Well


          1. **Plan-to-implementation flow** - The detailed plan from plan mode provided clear
          structure. Each phase had specific files to create/modify and ACs to cover.


          2. **Parallel task tracking** - Using both internal task list and kspec tasks kept work
          organized. The kspec task workflow (start → note → submit → complete after PR merge)
          worked smoothly.


          3. **Test-driven verification** - Writing tests alongside implementation caught issues
          early. The export tests (25 total) validated all AC coverage.


          4. **Incremental PR approach** - Creating separate PRs for fixes (workflow_dispatch
          trigger, Node.js version, base path) made debugging easier than one large PR.


          5. **Mode detection pattern** - The isStaticMode() guard pattern worked cleanly for
          conditionally disabling features without major refactoring.

          ## Friction Points


          1. **GitHub Actions workflow file location** - The gh-pages workflow only triggers when
          the workflow file exists on the branch being pushed (kspec-meta). Since it only existed on
          main, pushes to kspec-meta didn't trigger it. Required manual trigger via
          workflow_dispatch.


          2. **Node.js version mismatch** - The test.yml uses Node 18 but Vite requires 20.19+. This
          wasn't caught until CI failed. No central place defining Node version requirements.


          3. **GitHub Pages base path discovery** - Had to debug 404s to discover SvelteKit needs
          BASE_PATH for subdirectory hosting. The initial deployment looked successful but assets
          failed to load.


          4. **Checkout pollution** - Running 'git checkout origin/gh-pages -- .' accidentally
          staged 30+ files from gh-pages branch into main. Easy to make this mistake when checking
          file contents.


          5. **Multiple active workflow runs** - 49 workflow runs accumulated over time. Had to
          specify run ID explicitly. No cleanup mechanism or warning about stale runs.

          4. **Checkout pollution** - Not tracked. This is a git knowledge issue, not a kspec issue.


          5. **Multiple active workflow runs** - Not tracked. No spec for workflow run cleanup or
          limits.


          **Untracked friction points needing capture:**

          - Node version requirements documentation

          - Workflow run cleanup/limits

          - (Base path is now fixed, just needed documentation)

          ## Proposed Improvements


          1. **Workflow run cleanup command**
             - What: `kspec workflow prune` to cancel/complete stale workflow runs
             - How it helps: Prevents accumulation of 49+ active runs that require explicit IDs
             - Scope: Small - add command to cancel runs older than X days or in specific states

          2. **Node version in CI docs**
             - What: Document Node version requirements in AGENTS.md or CI section
             - How it helps: Prevents version mismatch between workflows
             - Scope: Small - documentation update

          3. **GitHub Pages deployment notes**
             - What: Add section to AGENTS.md about gh-pages workflow quirks (base path, workflow file location)
             - How it helps: Future reference for similar deployments
             - Scope: Small - documentation

          Only #1 is a code change; #2 and #3 are documentation that could be done now or captured
          as observations.
