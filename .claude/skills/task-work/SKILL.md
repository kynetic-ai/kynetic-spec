# Task Work Session

Structured workflow for working on tasks. Full lifecycle from start through PR merge.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the workflow
kspec workflow start @task-work-session
kspec workflow next --input task_ref="@task-slug"
```

## When to Use

- Starting work on a ready task
- Ensuring consistent task lifecycle
- When you need to track progress with notes

## Inherit Existing Work First

**Before starting new work, check for existing in-progress or pending_review tasks.**

```bash
kspec session start  # Shows active work at the top
```

Priority order:
1. **pending_review** - PR awaiting merge, highest priority
2. **in_progress** - Work already started, continue it
3. **ready (pending)** - New work to start

**Always inherit existing work** unless user explicitly says otherwise. If there's an in_progress task, pick it up and continue. If there's a pending_review task, check the PR status and push it to completion.

Only start new work when:
- No in_progress or pending_review tasks exist
- User explicitly tells you to work on something else
- User says to ignore the existing work

This prevents orphaned work and ensures tasks get completed.

## Task States

```
pending → in_progress → pending_review → completed
```

- `task start` → in_progress (working on it)
- `task submit` → pending_review (code done, PR created, awaiting merge)
- `task complete` → completed (PR merged)

## Workflow Overview

10 steps for full task lifecycle:

1. **Check Existing Work** - Inherit in_progress or pending_review tasks first
2. **Choose Task** - Select from ready tasks (if no existing work)
3. **Verify Not Done** - Check git history, existing code
4. **Start Task** - Mark in_progress
5. **Work & Note** - Add notes during work
6. **Commit** - Ensure changes committed with trailers
7. **Submit Task** - Mark pending_review
8. **Create PR** - Use /pr skill
9. **PR Merged** - Wait for review and merge
10. **Complete Task** - Mark completed after merge

## Key Commands

```bash
# See available tasks
kspec tasks ready

# Get task details
kspec task get @task-slug

# Start working (in_progress)
kspec task start @task-slug

# Add notes as you work
kspec task note @task-slug "What you're doing..."

# Submit for review (pending_review) - code done, PR ready
kspec task submit @task-slug

# Complete after PR merged (completed)
kspec task complete @task-slug --reason "Summary of what was done"
```

## Verification Step

Before starting, always check if work is already done:

```bash
# Check git history
git log --oneline --grep="feature-name"
git log --oneline -- path/to/relevant/files

# Read existing implementation
# If code exists and works, mark complete with "Already implemented"
```

This prevents duplicate work and wasted effort.

## Notes Best Practices

Add notes **during** work, not just at the end:

- When you discover something unexpected
- When you make a design decision
- When you encounter a blocker
- When you complete a significant piece

Good notes help future sessions understand context:

```bash
# Good: explains decision
kspec task note @task "Using retry with exponential backoff. Chose 3 max retries based on API rate limits."

# Bad: no context
kspec task note @task "Done"
```

## Commit Format

Include task trailer in commits:

```
feat: add user authentication

Implemented JWT-based auth with refresh tokens.
Sessions expire after 24h.

Task: @task-add-auth
Spec: @auth-feature

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

This enables `kspec log @task` to find related commits.

## Submit vs Complete

**Submit** (`task submit`):
- Use when code is done and you're creating a PR
- Task moves to `pending_review`
- Indicates "ready for review, not yet merged"

**Complete** (`task complete`):
- Use only after PR is merged to main
- Task moves to `completed`
- Indicates "work is done and shipped"

**Why this matters:**
- Tracks tasks awaiting merge separately from done tasks
- `kspec tasks ready` won't show pending_review tasks as available
- Gives accurate picture of what's in progress vs awaiting review

## After Completion

After completing a task:

1. Check if other tasks were unblocked: `kspec tasks ready`
2. Consider starting the next task
3. If work revealed new tasks/issues, add to inbox

## Integration with Other Workflows

- **Before submit**: Consider `/local-review` for quality check
- **After submit**: Use `/pr` to create PR
- **For merge**: Use `@pr-review-merge` workflow
- **After merge**: Complete the task

## Loop Mode

For autonomous agents (e.g., ralph), use `/task-work loop`:

```bash
# Invoked by ralph prompt - agent executes this
/task-work loop
```

### Key Differences from Interactive Mode

| Aspect | Interactive | Loop |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Task filtering | All tasks | automation: eligible only |
| Verification | Check git history | Skipped (trust task state) |
| Confirmations | User confirms | Auto-resolve |
| Task selection | User chooses | Priority order (see below) |
| pending_review | User handles PR | Spawn subagent |

### Loop Task Selection Order

1. **in_progress** - Continue existing work first
2. **pending_review** - Spawn `/pr-review` subagent
3. **Unblocking** - Tasks that unblock others preferred
4. **Priority** - Highest priority (lowest number)

### Exit Conditions

- **No eligible tasks**: Exits with "No eligible tasks" message
- **All blocked**: Exits with "All eligible tasks blocked" message

### Workflow Reference

```bash
# Check loop workflow details
kspec meta get @task-work-loop

# List all loop workflows
kspec meta workflows --tag loop
```
