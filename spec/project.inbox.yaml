      Subagent review on task complete - when agent marks task complete, include instructions to
      spawn review subagent. Subagent runs kspec task review to get task details, linked spec,
      acceptance criteria, git diff since started_at. Reports gaps between spec and implementation
      back to main agent. Configurable via setup (opt-in/out). Ties into alignment system.

      Shadow branch for auto-commit meta tracking - orphan branch (e.g., kspec-meta) that only
      contains spec/ directory. Auto-commits on kspec commands go to shadow branch, keeping main
      history clean. Reading task/spec state always pulls from shadow branch. Solves commit bloat
      problem for auto-tracking. Works with git directly or jj. Could be configured during kspec
      init.

      Hook for SessionStart or post-compaction to inject relevant context and subtle instructions.
      Could auto-run 'kspec session start' or similar to give agent fresh context after memory is
      compacted.

      Reflection prompt on task complete - when completing a task, prompt agent to reflect: Did this
      address workflow friction? Any new friction discovered? Successes worth noting? More flexible
      than auto-resolution or explicit linking. Could be a hook or built into task complete flow.

      AGENTS.md standard compatibility - consider complementary approach where AGENTS.md provides
      instructions and kynetic.meta.yaml provides structured/queryable layer. Revisit when standard
      matures (currently 20k+ repos adopting).

      Artifacts feature - storage for large files and non-text artifacts tied to specs/tasks. Use
      cases: reference images, research docs, generated diagrams, data files, PDFs. Unknowns:
      integration model (spec-ref? task-ref? standalone?), reference syntax (@artifact?),
      organization (by task? by type? flat?), cleanup/lifecycle (archive with task? manual?),
      storage location (artifacts/ dir? .kspec/artifacts?), git handling (LFS? gitignore?
      committed?).
