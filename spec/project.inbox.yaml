      Fuzzy search for spec/tasks - would help with finding items when you don't remember exact
      names

      Subagent review on task complete - when agent marks task complete, include instructions to
      spawn review subagent. Subagent runs kspec task review to get task details, linked spec,
      acceptance criteria, git diff since started_at. Reports gaps between spec and implementation
      back to main agent. Configurable via setup (opt-in/out). Ties into alignment system.

      Shadow branch for auto-commit meta tracking - orphan branch (e.g., kspec-meta) that only
      contains spec/ directory. Auto-commits on kspec commands go to shadow branch, keeping main
      history clean. Reading task/spec state always pulls from shadow branch. Solves commit bloat
      problem for auto-tracking. Works with git directly or jj. Could be configured during kspec
      init.

      validate --fix option for auto-fixing issues: invalid ULIDs (regenerate), spec format
      migrations (auto-upgrade schema), missing required fields (add defaults). Makes validation
      actionable not just diagnostic.
