        Problem: Spec, tasks, and implementation drift apart over time.


        Examples of drift:

        - Task @task-reference-resolution spec says nothing about dynamic ULID shortening, but that
        became a key implementation detail

        - User requests during implementation add features not in original spec

        - Implementation discoveries change the approach


        Goals:

        1. Keep specs as accurate source of truth

        2. Make drift visible and actionable

        3. Guide agents to update specs when deviating

        4. Enable reconciliation after the fact


        Potential mechanisms:


        PROACTIVE (during work):

        - Task start: show spec, prompt for planned deviations

        - Task complete: verify against acceptance criteria, prompt for spec updates

        - Agent instructions mandating spec updates when deviating


        REACTIVE (backprop):

        - kspec reconcile: compare task notes to spec, flag drift

        - Generate spec update suggestions from implementation notes

        - Mark specs 'needs-review' when notes mention unlisted changes


        STRUCTURAL:

        - Acceptance criteria as verifiable checkboxes

        - 'implementation_notes' field on spec items

        - Spec versioning when updated post-implementation

        - Deviation tracking on tasks


        Deliverables:

        1. Add spec items to spec/modules/ defining alignment features

        2. Create implementation tasks from the spec

        3. Update AGENTS.md with alignment guidance
