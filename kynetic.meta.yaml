          Notes are context, not proof. If a task is in the queue, there's a reason.

          To mark "Already implemented" you MUST:
          1. RUN the tests (npm test) - they must PASS, not skip
          2. VERIFY AC coverage - each AC has a corresponding test
          3. CHECK implementation matches spec requirements

          - Notes say "already done" (verify yourself)
          - Tests exist but skip in CI (that's a gap to fix)

          SCOPE EXPANSION: If you discover missing implementation while testing,

          Identify high-confidence friction points and successes.

          HIGH CONFIDENCE criteria (ac-2, ac-4):
          - Concrete and specific (not vague)
          - Systemic/repeatable (not one-off)
          - Clear cause and effect
          - Agent has certainty about the pattern

          LOW CONFIDENCE (DO NOT capture):
          - Vague observations
          - Uncertain patterns
          - One-off issues
          - Hypothetical problems

          For each item identified, check against search results from step 1.
      - type: decision
        content: |
          For each potential item, evaluate against existing state:

          AC-3: If matches existing observation/inbox/task -> SKIP IT, note existing ref
          AC-4: If unique AND high-confidence -> CAPTURE IT
          AC-2: If vague/uncertain -> SKIP IT

          Decision matrix:
          - Duplicate of existing item -> skip, note reference
          - Unique + high confidence -> capture
          - Vague/uncertain -> skip silently
      - type: action

          - Open questions: kspec meta question add "..."
          - Actionable improvements with scope: kspec inbox add "..." --tag reflection

          Only capture items that passed the evaluation in step 3.

    id: pr-review-loop
    trigger: loop-pr-review
    description: PR review subagent workflow for loop mode. Runs local review, verifies AC coverage and
      spec alignment, fixes issues, waits for CI, and merges with quality gates. Sequential
      execution (ralph waits).
    steps:
      - type: action
        content: |
          Run local review workflow first (ac-1).
          Use: /local-review skill or kspec workflow start @local-review

          This checks:
          - AC coverage (all spec ACs have test annotations)
          - Test quality (no fluff tests, proper isolation)
          - E2E preference (integration tests over unit tests where appropriate)
          - Test isolation (temp directories, cleanup)
      - type: check
        content: |
          Verify all spec ACs linked to task have test coverage (ac-2).

          Check test files for AC annotations: // AC: @spec-ref ac-N
          Cross-reference with spec ACs from task.spec_ref

          MUST-FIX if:
          - Spec has ACs but no tests reference them
          - Tests exist but don't cover all ACs
        on_fail: |
          Add missing test coverage before continuing.
          Tests must validate AC behavior, not just implementation.
      - type: check
        content: |
          Verify implementation matches spec requirements (ac-3).

          This is NOT just "do tests pass" - verify:
          - Implementation aligns with spec description
          - All AC conditions are actually implemented
          - No deviation from spec without justification

          Read spec, read implementation, compare.
        on_fail: |
          Fix misalignment between spec and implementation.
          Update code to match spec, or note why deviation is necessary.
      - type: decision
        content: |
          Evaluate local-review findings (ac-4).

          If MUST-FIX issues found:
          - Attempt to fix them in-place
          - Run tests after fixes
          - Push changes

          If issues cannot be resolved:
          - Mark task automation: needs_review with explanation (ac-8)
          - EXIT workflow

          Decision matrix:
          - MUST-FIX issues, can fix -> Fix and continue
          - MUST-FIX issues, cannot fix -> Mark needs_review, EXIT
          - Only advisory issues -> Continue with merge
          - No issues -> Continue with merge
      - type: action
        content: |
          Push changes (if any fixes were made).
          Use: git push

          This triggers CI to run on latest code.

          NOTE: Only push if changes were actually made during issue fixing.
      - type: check
        content: |
          Wait for CI to complete and pass (ac-5).

          Poll CI status until all checks complete.
          Use: gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup

          Do NOT merge while checks are running or failing.
        on_fail: |
          If CI fails:
          - Investigate failure
          - Fix if possible
          - Push changes
          - Wait for CI again

          If cannot fix:
          - Mark task automation: needs_review with CI failure details (ac-8)
          - EXIT workflow
      - type: action
        content: |
          Follow PR review merge gates (ac-6).
          Use: kspec workflow start @pr-review-merge

          This ensures:
          - All CI checks pass
          - All review feedback addressed
          - All @claude requests completed
          - All review threads resolved

          Only merge when all gates pass.
      - type: check
        content: |
          Verify PR was successfully merged.
          Use: gh pr view --json state,mergedAt

          Confirm state is MERGED.
        on_fail: |
          If merge failed:
          - Check for conflicts or protection rules
          - Attempt resolution
          - If cannot resolve: mark automation: needs_review (ac-8)
          - EXIT workflow
      - type: action
        content: |
          Mark task completed with PR reference (ac-7).
          Use: kspec task complete @task --reason "Merged in PR #N. <summary>"

          Include in reason:
          - PR number
          - Summary of what was implemented
          - Any notable changes or deviations
          - AC coverage confirmation
      - type: action
        content: |
          Check for friction during PR review (ac-11).

          If significant friction encountered (not one-off):
          1. Search existing observations first:
             kspec meta observations list --type friction
          2. Only capture if unique:
             kspec meta observe friction "[REVIEW SUBAGENT] <description>"

          Be selective - systemic patterns only, not one-off issues.
          This step is optional - only capture if friction was encountered.

      showed this: early PRs for small wins, direct commits for established patterns. Tests catch
      issues early, smaller files build confidence. Having checkpoints and running totals (e.g.,

      No ambiguity about what to build or where to put it. Good example of actionable task with
      minimal design decisions needed.

      Test-first debugging pattern worked excellently for batch operations

      The PR review subagent identified a critical bug: resolveTaskRef() called process.exit() 
      instead of returning errors, breaking partial failure handling.

      The fix process was clean:
      1. Review identified the bug with clear evidence
      2. Created batch-compatible resolver that returns {task, error}
      3. Updated batch.ts to expect new format
      4. All existing tests passed (no regression)
      5. Added 9 new tests covering all 8 ACs
      6. Tests caught edge cases (ambiguous ULID prefixes)

      Key insight: When refactoring error handling, create new functions instead of modifying
      existing ones. The original resolveTaskRef() serves single-ref commands that should exit
      on error. The new resolveTaskRefForBatch() serves batch commands that should continue.

      This separation of concerns made the fix safe and testable.

    content: Implemented kspec setup worktree detection cleanly by leveraging existing shadow module
      utilities. The repairShadow() function already handled the complex worktree creation logic, so
      implementation was primarily about adding the detection and prompting layer. This demonstrates
      the value of the shadow module's well-factored utilities for worktree management.

      Manually editing .kspec/kynetic.yaml to add traits requires:

      1. Understanding ULID format constraints (no I, L, O, U chars)

      2. Manually generating valid ULIDs

      3. Working around shadow branch auto-commit restrictions


      The kspec trait add command would have handled all this, but for bulk creation of 8 traits
      with detailed AC, manual YAML editing was more practical. Future improvement: support adding
      AC during trait creation, or bulk trait import from YAML file.

      Iteration 8: Successfully implemented @01KFC3AR (--description flag for task add) from start
      to PR creation. Pattern that worked well:

      1. Read spec to understand all ACs

      2. Check existing schema (description field already existed)

      3. Add CLI option and wire to TaskInput

      4. Write comprehensive tests FIRST with AC annotations

      5. Fix shell escaping issues in tests (not implementation bugs)

      6. All 792 tests pass on first implementation try

      7. Created PR with full context


      Total time: ~15 minutes for feature + tests + PR. Clean handoff to next iteration.

      1. Reviewed PR #118 (log empty repo fix) - comprehensive review passed
      2. Implemented @01KFC3AR (--description flag) with full AC coverage
      3. Created PR #119 for --description implementation
      4. Fixed failing CI test in PR #118 (missing git config)
      5. Captured observations (success + friction patterns)

      Key patterns:
      - PR review workflow with subagent worked well
      - Implementation -> tests -> PR flow is smooth
      - CI failures often reveal env config issues (git user.name/email)
      - Test patterns: always configure git after init in temp dirs

      Both PRs now ready for merge once CI completes.
